/**
 * The colour-profile panel - where an `.icc` on this device becomes a comparison
 * target the Colour Lab can chart against.
 *
 * ## Why it is not a *print* panel
 *
 * It was titled "Print profile", and that was never what the code did: `ingestProfile`
 * has always accepted any profile it can ask a gamut question of, and a `mntr` display
 * profile is exactly as valid a comparison target as a press condition - it simply has
 * no ink to report. The title claimed a restriction the ingest path does not enforce,
 * which is the kind of stale claim a reader can only discover by dropping a file and
 * being surprised. So the panel is "Colour profiles", and print is one SECTION in it.
 *
 * Loaded profiles are grouped by what the file says it is - `deviceClass` first,
 * `dataColourSpace` only as a fallback for rows stored before the class was recorded
 * ({@link groupFor}) - never by guessing from its name. Three groups:
 *
 * - **Print** (`prtr`, or an ink space): the press conditions an export can declare.
 * - **Display** (`mntr`): a screen. The ICC publishes an sRGB v2 profile under terms
 *   that plainly allow it, so this section has one preset of its own; everything else
 *   here is a file the reader brought. Apple's `Display P3.icc` is NOT redistributable
 *   and Elle Stone's set is CC-BY-SA, so neither is offered (plans/60-color-spaces.md section 11.8).
 * - **Other**: `scnr`, `spac`, `nmcl` - a class that characterises neither a press nor a
 *   screen. A scanner profile describes what a device can SEE, and a `spac` conversion
 *   profile (the ICC's own sRGB v4 preference is one) describes a transform, not a
 *   device; filing either under Display would be a claim the file does not make. The
 *   section is hidden when empty, and its rows print the class in words, because for
 *   these the class is the interesting fact. They are still chartable - this panel
 *   groups, it does not refuse.
 *
 * A library, not a setting: dropping a file ADDS it, and pressing one of its
 * intent buttons is the separate, deliberate act that repoints the charts. That
 * split is `lib/color-profiles.ts`'s (ingest ≠ activate) and this panel does not
 * blur it - a drop that was only meant to stock the library never moves the
 * report out from under the reader.
 *
 * ## Why intent is a control here and not a fourth tab out there
 *
 * A gamut question without a rendering intent is under-specified: the same
 * profile is a different gamut under `perceptual` than under `absolute`, which is
 * why the intent is part of `GamutSource.id` rather than an argument. But four
 * pills per profile in the Lab's comparison row is exactly the tab-row failure
 * section 11.6b describes. So the row out there carries ONE profile pill and the intent
 * choice lives on the profile's own row in here, next to the file it belongs to.
 *
 * An intent the profile has no table for is rendered UNAVAILABLE, never hidden:
 * "this file has no saturation table" is a real fact about the file (macOS's
 * Generic Lab Profile is exactly that case), and hiding the button would leave a
 * reader wondering whether we simply did not offer it. It carries `aria-disabled`
 * rather than `disabled` so it still takes focus and can still answer why.
 *
 * ## The press-condition rows
 *
 * The Print section lists the conditions an export can DECLARE in its OutputIntent,
 * and every row is a button. It was a readout, which was honest and useless - FOGRA39
 * and SWOP are the first two things a print reader looks for. Pressing one charts the
 * condition when its profile is here, fetches it from the ICC registry when there is a
 * licence-clean source (`lib/press-conditions.ts`), and otherwise opens the picker
 * naming the filename to look for. Declaring a condition still needs no profile at
 * all: nothing here gates an export.
 *
 * ## Refusals
 *
 * Two, both from `ingestProfile`, both stated in one line and neither in a modal:
 * a file the reader cannot parse, and a profile no intent can be asked a gamut
 * question in. Nothing else is refused - an RGB monitor profile is a perfectly
 * good comparison target, it simply has no ink to report.
