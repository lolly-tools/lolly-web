/**
 * collab-focus - remote focus decorations: the sidebar ring and the canvas outline
 * (plan 100 section 4.1, section 4.6, section 4.8, section 11.14).
 *
 * Focus, not x/y, is the presence primitive that ships on EVERY tool (section 4.1): the
 * canvas is a rendered preview rather than a freeform surface, so "Priya is editing
 * the Headline" is both truer and cheaper than a floating arrow. One roster stream
 * therefore drives TWO decorations, and the interesting part of this module is that
 * the two are allowed to touch the DOM in completely different ways.
 *
 * THE ASYMMETRY, STATED ONCE, BECAUSE IT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN:
 *
 *  - **The SIDEBAR is chrome.** It is re-rendered by the shell, it never appears in
 *    an export, and its rows already carry shell-owned state classes (`.is-target`,
 *    `.is-collapsed`). So a remote focus there is exactly what the plan asks for: a
 *    row-level `.is-remote-focus` class plus a chip stack appended to the row. Both
 *    are re-applied idempotently, because `renderInputs` rebuilds the whole panel's
 *    innerHTML on every keystroke and would otherwise wash them away.
 *  - **The CANVAS is the user's artwork.** Nothing here writes a class, an attribute
 *    or a node into it - not once, not "just a data attribute". Two independent
 *    reasons, and either alone would be enough: an export must stay byte-identical
 *    (section 4.6), and the tool's own paint replaces `#tool-canvas`'s innerHTML wholesale,
 *    so anything written in would be clobbered within a keystroke anyway. Outlines
 *    are therefore drawn on a SIBLING overlay layer, positioned from the annotated
 *    elements' `getBoundingClientRect`, and re-anchored on paint / scroll / resize.
 *
 * HOW A FOCUS STRING FINDS A NODE. The contract carries `focus` as an input id, or
 * `"<blocksId>:<rowId>"` for a blocks row (canvas-op v1.1, `Presence.focus`) - a
 * STABLE row id, because an array index is not an identity when two peers insert
 * concurrently (lib/row-id.ts). The DOM, however, addresses blocks by INDEX:
 * `.block-item[data-block-index]` in the sidebar, and `data-canvas-input="<id>:<n>"`
 * on the canvas (the `annotateTemplate` markers `resolveCanvasAnnotations` converts).
 * So this module owns the one mapping between them: id → index, resolved through the
 * runtime's input model, which is the same array both renderers numbered. The
 * mapping is deliberately re-derived on every apply rather than cached - a remote
 * insert renumbers every row below it, and a cache would point the ring at the wrong
 * card exactly when a collaborator is adding rows.
 *
 * REMOTE FOCUS IDS ARE UNTRUSTED INPUT (section 11.21). They are matched by SCANNING
 * `dataset` values, never by interpolating into a `querySelector` string: a peer
 * controls that string, and a crafted or merely malformed one is a thrown
 * `SyntaxError` at best and a selector that matches somewhere else at worst. The
 * scan costs a walk of a handful of nodes and removes the class of bug entirely.
 *
 * A11Y (section 4.8). Colour is never the only differentiator - the sidebar wash is paired
 * with a name CHIP, the canvas outline with a name LABEL and a theme-ground hairline
 * that reads as a shape rather than a hue, and every focus handoff is spoken through
 * `announce()`. The chips are `aria-hidden` ON PURPOSE and that is not an oversight:
 * an `.input-row` is usually a `<label>`, so visible text appended inside it would be
 * absorbed into the wrapped control's accessible name and a screen-reader user would
 * hear "Headline Priya" as the field's label. The live region carries the same
 * information without corrupting the form. Reduced motion removes the outline's
 * transition (rings do not move on their own, so they need nothing else - section 4.8).
 * Every glyph and offset in the sheet below is `calc(<px> * var(--a11y-fs))`.
 *
 * IT CARRIES ITS OWN STYLESHEET, injected into `<head>` on first mount, exactly like
 * `collab-overlay.ts` and `collab-pill.ts` - the lazy-chrome pattern that keeps a
 * single-player build byte-identical. `styles/parts/collab.css` owns ONLY the
 * `.collab-tile-*` family and says so in its own header; an unlayered injected sheet
 * beats every `@layer`, so a shared `parts/*.css` rule using one of these bare class
 * names would be silently inert here and a confusing duplicate everywhere else. So
 * `.is-remote-focus` (named verbatim in the plan), `.collab-focus-chip`,
 * `.collab-focus-box` and `.collab-focus-box-label` are defined below and nowhere
 * else; `.collab-canvas-layer` and the cursor classes belong to `collab-overlay.ts`,
 * whose sheet is ensured by the same mount. What stays INLINE is geometry no sheet
 * can know: the outline's measured rect and the per-collaborator `--collab-color`.
