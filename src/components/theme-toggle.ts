/**
 * Theme cycle toggle — one compact, icon-only button that steps through the
 * themes (light → dark → brand → …) on click, showing the active theme's glyph.
 * It lives in the canvas zoom HUD (.stage-nav) so every tool with a live canvas
 * — including the chromeless editor/Layout Studio — carries a theme switcher,
 * and the sidebar header stays uncluttered.
 *
 * Icon-only with a tooltip (title + aria-label carry the theme name), styled as
 * a .stage-nav-btn so it matches the zoom controls it sits with (see
 * .stage-nav-theme in editor.css).
 *
 * The profile is the canonical theme store (localStorage is only the FOUC mirror,
 * kept in sync by applyTheme), so each switch is persisted there too — mirroring
 * the profile view's segmented control.
 *
 * createThemeToggle(host, opts?) → HTMLButtonElement
 *
 * `opts.className` exists because the `.stage-nav-*` presentation lives in
 * editor.css, which only the editor routes load. A view that wants the same
 * icon-only cycle without pulling the whole editor chrome in (Colour Lab, whose
 * users switch theme to see a colour in each screen context) passes its own class
 * and styles it locally — the cycling, the sting and the profile write are the
 * parts worth sharing, not the skin.
