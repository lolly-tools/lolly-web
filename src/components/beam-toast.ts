 * beam-toast - the consent + progress UI for a **beam** (plan 100 §6.4, §4.6 point 6:
 * "Beam: progress/consent rides the existing toast/progress pill pattern (`.pro-toast`
 * family), with cancel; never a blocking modal.").
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT. It never imports `../collab/beam-protocol.ts`'s
 * `BeamSender`/`BeamReceiver` (only their exported TYPES, for the reason vocabulary),
 * never touches `RTCDataChannel`, and never imports any of the in-flight collab UI
 * (`collab-pill.ts`, `collab-ceremony.ts`, `collab-focus.ts`, `collab-overlay.ts`).
 * Like `beam-protocol.ts` itself, this is a pure consumer of a documented contract - 
 * here, an EVENT STREAM rather than a wire - so it mounts and is fully exercised
 * headlessly with a fake {@link BeamEventSource}, with no transport, no worker, and no
 * beam-protocol instance anywhere in this file or its test.
 *
 * ── The event union ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * {@link BeamToastEvent} is shaped to be a thin, direct read of
 * `BeamSender`/`BeamReceiver`'s own `subscribe(state => …)` surface (see
 * `beam-protocol.ts`'s `BeamSendState`/`BeamRecvState`/`BeamProgress`), so an adapter
 * written elsewhere has almost nothing to translate:
 *
 *   beam-protocol phase transition                    → BeamToastEvent
 *   -------------------------------------------------    -----------------
 *   an offer exists (`'offered'`, either side)         → 'offer-received'
 *   the peer accepted (sender) / I accepted (receiver) → 'accepted'
 *   `nextChunk()` / `receiveBinary()` advance `progress`→ 'progress'
 *   an item's `finalize`+verify settles                → 'item-done'
 *   `'complete'`                                       → 'complete'
 *   `'declined'` or `'cancelled'`                       → 'cancelled' { reason }
 *
 * `BeamSendState.reason`/`BeamRecvState.reason` is already typed `BeamEndReason`
 * (`BeamCancelReason | BeamDeclineReason`), imported here as a TYPE ONLY, so the copy
 * map below is exhaustive against the real wire vocabulary and a future reason added
 * to the protocol fails this file's typecheck instead of rendering silently blank.
 *
 * ── The action channel ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Events flow ONE way, adapter → toast. The toast never mutates its own idea of a
 * beam's state on a click - it calls back through {@link BeamEventSource}'s
 * `accept`/`decline`/`cancel` (the same object that supplies `subscribe`, doing double
 * duty as a small port rather than forcing a second constructor argument) and waits for
 * the resulting event to arrive before it paints anything new. That is what makes
 * "fires accept/decline once" a real guarantee rather than a UI promise: a second click
 * cannot desync the toast from whatever beam-protocol actually decided, because the
 * toast never decided anything on its own. The same rule runs the other way: an event
 * that arrives out of order never PROMOTES a card past a decision the human has not
 * made. A `progress` frame for a card still showing the consent sheet is dropped, not
 * treated as an implied acceptance - see `apply()`'s `progress` case.
 *
 * ── Queueing (§6.4: "never a blocking modal … multiple beams queue, one visible at a
 * time") ──
 *
 * One `mountBeamToast()` call is a single toast HOST that can receive events for
 * several different `beamId`s over time (e.g. two people beam something back to back,
 * or an outgoing beam and an incoming one overlap). Internally it is a FIFO queue of
 * per-beam card state; only the front of the queue is ever painted. A card is removed
 * from the queue ONLY by an explicit dismiss (the ✕), which is offered ONLY once a beam
 * has reached a terminal state (`complete`/`cancelled`) - there is deliberately no way
 * to "hide" a beam that is still being decided or still in flight, so a queued offer
 * never silently pre-empts one the human hasn't answered yet, and a queued beam never
 * quietly loses its own terminal result before it's been shown.
 *
 * ── A11y ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `announce()` fires at exactly three moments - a consent request landing (receiver
 * role only: the sender's own "waiting to be accepted" card is not a request FOR the
 * local human), completion, and failure - never on every progress tick, which would
 * spam a live region on a beam sending many small chunks. Progress is instead exposed
 * the way a progress bar should be: `role="progressbar"` + `aria-valuenow` on both bars
 * (current item and running total), read on demand rather than narrated continuously.
 * The entrance animation is reduced-motion-guarded in `beam-toast.css`; nothing else
 * here moves.
 *
 * ── Copy ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One map, one namespace. Every value in {@link STRINGS} IS its own catalog key - 
 * `i18n.ts` looks a translation up by the English source - and the lazy `collab`
 * namespace carries the translations (this copy appears only once a collab is running,
 * so it has no business in a boot catalog). `tRaw`, not `t`: every string below is
 * `escape()`d at its sink or handed to `announce()`, so t()'s param escaping would
 * double-escape a peer's name into `O&#39;Brien`.
