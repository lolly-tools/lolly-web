/**
 * Shared shell for a body-mounted anchored popover - the machinery lang-menu.ts
 * and profile-menu.ts used to hand-roll twice: mount a `<div>` on `document.body`,
 * position it off the trigger's rect, trap focus inside it, and tear it down on
 * Escape, an outside pointerdown, a window resize, or a route change (any of
 * NAV_EVENTS - the popover lives outside the view tree, so a hash/route change
 * would otherwise orphan it).
 *
 * `render(el, popover)` builds the popover's own content fresh on every open
 * (item lists, current-value checks, etc. can change between opens) and wires
 * whatever internal listeners it needs (item clicks, roving-tabindex arrow keys);
 * it returns the element that should receive initial focus, or null/undefined to
 * leave focus where it is. The shell only owns the generic lifecycle - callers
 * keep deciding what the trigger's own click handler does (profile-menu, e.g.,
 * only intercepts the click at a mobile breakpoint).
 *
 * inertBackground is always off: the trigger that opens one of these anchored
 * dropdowns lives in the same branch `trapFocus` would otherwise inert (see its
 * module doc), which would kill the trigger's own re-click-to-close affordance.
 *
 * The anchor need not be a real trigger element: `PopoverAnchor` is the minimal
 * shape `position()`/the outside-click check actually use, so a context menu that
 * opens at a pointer position (a right-click, a kebab button's corner) can pass a
 * `pointAnchor()` instead of forking this whole lifecycle - see projects.ts's and
 * folder-overlay.ts's tile context menus. `container` (default `document.body`)
 * lets a popover opened from WITHIN a native `<dialog open>` mount inside that
 * dialog instead - required for it to paint above the dialog's own `::backdrop`
 * (only the top-layer dialog's own subtree renders above its backdrop).
 *
 * On a touch device an open popover also takes system Back, via the shared overlay
 * stack (lib/overlay-back.ts) that mountModal registers on too: one press closes the
 * innermost overlay, so a menu opened over a dialog closes and the dialog stays. See
 * the pointer gate in `open()` for why a fine-pointer desktop pushes no entry.
