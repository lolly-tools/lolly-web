 * collab-ceremony - the invite and accept dialogs of a private collab
 * (plan 100 section 6.1, section 4.5, section 11.25, section 11.26; wave 2.2).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The human half of `collab/ceremony.ts`. That module owns the order of
 * events and nothing else; this one owns the screens the two people actually work
 * through, numbered 1-2-3 on every screen because section 11.25 says the QR Tango survives
 * only when the UI says which step the pair is on. Nothing here decides when a
 * ceremony ends - it renders `machine.state.phase` and feeds events back in.
 *
 * WHY EVERY PLATFORM PIECE ARRIVES THROUGH `opts`. The dialog never imports the RTC
 * provider, the QR encoder or the camera: the transport arrives as `effects` (an
 * object or a factory), the QR as `renderQr`, the scanner as `scan`. Three reasons,
 * in order of weight: the provider is another wave's file and would drag WebRTC into
 * every bundle that shows a share dialog; `BarcodeDetector` is Chromium-only
 * (section 11.27), so scanning has to be an absent capability rather than a broken button;
 * and the whole flow then runs under jsdom with stub effects and a fake clock, which
 * is the only way the ten-minute re-arm and the isolation timeout are testable at all.
 *
 * THE TRANSPORT CONTRACT IS THREE THINGS, NOT ONE ({@link CeremonyEffectsBundle}).
 * The four `CeremonyEffects` mint and apply the blobs, and on their own they are only
 * two thirds of a pairing:
 *
 *   - `events(send)` is how the transport's ICE reaches the machine. WITHOUT IT NO
 *     PAIRING EVER CONNECTS: `connected` is only ever entered from an `ice` event, so
 *     an unwired ceremony parks in `connecting` / `awaiting-connection` until a
 *     watchdog calls it a failure. It is optional purely so a test stub that drives
 *     the machine by hand does not have to implement it.
 *   - `close()` is the teardown. Every cancelled, failed and restarted ceremony hands
 *     its transport back through it; a peer connection plus three data channels is not
 *     something to leave to the garbage collector, and a `timeout` failure leaves one
 *     still gathering. The one exception is ownership transfer: once the pair is live
 *     and `onConnected` has fired, the channel belongs to the session and this dialog
 *     never closes it.
 *
 * THE THREE STEPS, PER ROLE.
 *
 *   inviter   1. name the invite, mint it, show it (link / code / QR)
 *             2. wait for the reply - paste or scan it, with the 10-minute re-arm
 *                counted down in the open and "Make a new invite" always available
 *             3. connect, then hand off through `onConnected`
 *
 *   acceptor  1. paste or scan the invite
 *             2. the tool probe's verdict, then the name field
 *             3. show the reply back (link / code / QR), then connect
 *
 * The acceptor's step 2 runs `checkTool` BEFORE the machine exists, so the probe's
 * verdict can be shown before asking for a name (section 6.1 wants the refusal at accept
 * time, and asking someone to name themselves for a collab that cannot happen is
 * rude). The machine re-runs the same probe when it starts; it is a local catalog
 * lookup, and the machine stays the authority on the outcome.
 *
 * A MISSING TOOL IS A REFUSAL, NOT A DEGRADED JOIN (section 6.1, section 11.22). Peers send values,
 * never code, so the template and hooks always come from the local catalog. The copy
 * names the tool rather than saying "something went wrong".
 *
 * UNREADABLE TEXT NEVER REACHES THE MACHINE. `collab/ceremony.ts`'s header pins this:
 * signals cross that boundary as decoded envelopes, so a mangled paste is this file's
 * problem and must not spend a ceremony. Every pasted or scanned string goes through
 * `readSignal` (the real `sdp-codec`) first; only a decoded payload becomes an event.
 *
 * A11Y. A live region on every step change and every terminal state, focus moved to the
 * step heading (which carries `tabindex="-1"`), Escape mapped to the machine's own
 * cancel event through `mountModal`'s `cancel` handling, and no motion anywhere: the
 * in-flight screens are a heading plus a `role="status"` line, never a pulsing spinner,
 * so `reduceMotion` has nothing to switch off.
 *
 * That live region is mounted INSIDE the `<dialog>` rather than reusing the shell's
 * body-level `announce()`. `mountModal` opens with the native `showModal()`, and the
 * HTML modal-dialog steps mark every node outside the dialog inert; an inert subtree is
 * excluded from the accessibility tree and there is no per-element opt-out from
 * UA-applied inertness. `a11y.ts`'s `data-a11y-live` marker only protects a region from
 * `lib/focus-trap.ts`'s hand-rolled sweep, which is for `role="dialog"` DIV overlays - 
 * it buys nothing here, so every announcement made through it would be dropped.
 *
 * Focus moves only when the STEP changes, never on a countdown tick and never on a
 * validation notice - and a re-render restores the caret and the selection to whatever
 * field held them, with the typed text intact. section 11.25 already calls the reply leg the
 * ceremony's weak point; a dialog that wipes the paste field to tell you the paste was
 * wrong is what makes it one.
 *
 * COPY. Every user-visible string lives in {@link STRINGS}, and every value in that map
 * IS its catalog key: `i18n.ts` looks a translation up by the English source, so the map
 * is both the copy and the extraction list (scripts/translate.ts's `collab` corpus slices
 * it out of this file). Rendering goes through `tRaw(STRINGS.x, params)` - `tRaw` rather
 * than `t` because every string here lands in `textContent`, an attribute or the dialog's
 * live region, never an HTML sink, and t()'s param escaping would render a collaborator
 * called O'Brien as `O&#39;Brien`. Peer-supplied text (a display name, a tool id) only
 * ever reaches the DOM through `textContent`, never a markup sink - the same rule the
 * rest of `collab/` follows, because those strings come from a stranger.
 *
 * The copy is a LAZY namespace (section 2 of the collab i18n wave): its ~180 strings are needed
 * only once someone is actually starting or joining a collab, so they stay out of every
 * boot catalog and load with the dialog (that reasoning is about WHEN the copy is needed,
 * and survives `private-collab` going ON by default on 2026-08-10). English needs no load
 * at all, and an unloaded/untranslated namespace falls back to English string for string,
 * exactly like any missing key.
