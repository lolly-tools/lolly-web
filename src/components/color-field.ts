/**
 * Shared colour picker — the ONE colour field used across the app.
 *
 * Renders the palette swatches + value entry + alpha + native picker + current
 * swatch, and wires their behaviour. Both the single-tool sidebar (views/tool.ts)
 * and the /pro batch grid use this, so there is a single implementation to
 * maintain (no per-view variations).
 *
 * Markup styling lives in styles/parts/components.css (`.color-picker-field`,
 * `.color-popover`, `.color-swatch`, `.color-trigger`, …) — global, so it applies
 * wherever this markup is mounted.
 *
 *   colorFieldHtml(id, value, { float, modes, dials })   → HTML string for one field
 *   wireColorField(scopeEl, { onChange, onInteractStart, onInteractEnd })
 *
 * `float` makes the popover position itself (fixed) anchored to the trigger and
 * close on outside-click — for hosts where the field sits inside a clipping /
 * scrolling container (the /pro grid). Regular sidebar fields use plain CSS
 * positioning; block-colour fields keep their sidebar-spanning behaviour.
 *
 * ── ONE CssColor per field ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A field's truth is a single `CssColor` in `STATE`, in the space it was authored
 * in. Everything on screen is a projection of it, and every space is DATA (see
 * color-spaces.ts) rather than a hand-written state machine. What that replaced:
 * an sRGB-hex spine — `genFromHex`/`genToHex` round-tripped every HSL/RGB/CMYK
 * drag through `#rrggbb`, which is precisely why a wide-gamut or perceptual space
 * could not exist here. A `color(display-p3 1 0 0)` handed to the picker came back
 * as `#ff0b0c`, so Colour Lab reported every colour as sRGB.
 *
 * What is EMITTED is unchanged: `onChange(id, value)`'s `value` is still a
 * lowercase `#rrggbb` / `#rrggbbaa` / `'transparent'` (or `{ref, value}` for a
 * token swatch). The canonical colour rides along in an additive third argument,
 * `detail`, so consumers upgrade one at a time. Widening the emitted string would
 * corrupt data today: `engine/src/url-mode.ts` prefixes a non-`#` colour param
 * with `'#'` on every compact-URL round trip, and three consumers silently
 * DISCARD a non-hex rather than erroring.
 *
 * Exactly one function emits — `emit()` — and it is called only from a pointer /
 * keyboard / `input` / click handler. Never from `selectMode`, `onSelect`, any
 * `seed*` or any `paint*`. A mount-time emit is the bug that made every Colour Lab
 * colour read "sRGB", and jsdom never fires `input`, so the only guard against
 * reintroducing it is the zero-calls-after-wiring test in color-field.test.ts.

 * the sidebar carries `backdrop-filter: blur()`, and every `.input-row` keeps a computed
 * `translate: 0px` from the `card-in` enter animation's `both` fill-mode — and a non-`none`
 * `translate` establishes a containing block even at zero (a computed value other than
 * `none`, not a visible offset, is the trigger). Either way a popover portalled to `fixed`
 * lands on the controls below its trigger. Callers subtract this origin so their
 * viewport-space coords stay correct; returns {0,0} (a no-op) when nothing traps `fixed`.
