/**
 * The always-home FAB — a history-INDEPENDENT escape to the front door (Tools).
 *
 * The nav-less "focused" views (#/start, Dashboard, Profile, Verify) paint no
 * global nav of their own; their only other exit is the back pill. The pill
 * answers "where did I come from" and rides history; this answers "just get me
 * out" and never consults the back stack — so a view reached mid-session, after
 * a few hops, is never a one-way trip regardless of what sits behind it. (The
 * pill still traps nobody on its own now that within-view navigations replace
 * rather than push — see components/back-pill.ts — but a guaranteed, history-free
 * Home is the belt to that braces, and the same affordance on every nav-less
 * view reads as one consistent way out.)
 *
 * Sits in the fixed top-right cluster (.gallery-topright / .plat-header) beside
 * the language FAB and wears the same glass (buttons.css) + glow (overrides.css);
 * the box is `.home-fab` (topbar.css). homeFabHtml() renders the trigger,
 * mountHomeFab(root) wires it — mirrors langFabHtml()/attachLangMenu() so the
 * cluster stays "one of the set". homeFabEl() is the same control as a ready-wired
 * ELEMENT, for views that build their DOM with createElement rather than an
 * innerHTML template (the collab ceremony routes) and so have no free sink to
 * ride.
