/**
 * The spotlight overlay's boot registration, without the overlay.
 *
 * `components/spotlight.ts` is ~5 KB of panel chrome, grouping and combobox
 * navigation that only ever runs once someone searches - but its `initSpotlight`
 * had to be called synchronously at boot, because a bar with no registered hook
 * silently swallows the query and the ⌘/⌃Space chord (search-bar.ts's
 * `spotlightHook?.` reads). So the whole overlay sat on the render-blocking
 * preload set to reserve a slot it usually never uses (plans/155 WP-3).
 *
 * A SHIM, not a deferral. Deferring the registration to load/idle would have left
 * a real hole - on a slow cold load `window.load` can be seconds after the bar
 * paints, and the person typing in that window would get nothing, silently. What
 * registers here instead answers the bar's three questions from first paint and
 * fetches the overlay on the FIRST of them, then re-registers the real hook
 * (`registerSpotlightHook` is last-wins) and replays the query that triggered the
 * load. So the only observable difference is that the first search resolves a
 * chunk fetch later - the same trade the provider set already makes one layer in.
 *
 * `onKeydown` answers `false` while loading, which is correct rather than
 * convenient: it means "the bar handles this normally", and with no panel open
 * there is nothing for Arrow/Enter/Escape to act on - exactly what the real hook
 * returns in that state.
