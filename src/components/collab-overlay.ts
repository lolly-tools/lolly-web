/**
 * collab-overlay - the remote x/y cursor layer (plan 100 section 4.3, section 4.6, section 4.8, section 11.14).
 *
 * A cursor is the ONE presence primitive that moves, and it is the only one that
 * costs a frame loop. Everything about this module is shaped by that: it runs a
 * single rAF ticker, only while at least one remote cursor is live, and it paints
 * into a layer that is a SIBLING of the canvas stage - never a child. The tool's
 * render is untouched, byte for byte, which is the section 4.6 rule ("presence chrome
 * never goes inside `.tool-canvas`/`#tool-content` or any export stage"): a
 * collaborator's cursor must not be able to change what a PNG comes out looking
 * like, and an overlay that lives outside the stage cannot.
 *
 * COORDINATES ARE NORMALIZED, NOT PIXELS (section 4.3). A peer broadcasts `cursor` as
 * 0..1 of the design's unit space, so a phone at 0.4× and a desktop at 2× paint the
 * same point on the same artwork. The mapping is one multiply through the STAGE's
 * live rect, re-read each tick, then rebased into the layer's own coordinate space
 * - so a zoom, a scroll or a sidebar resize needs no invalidation protocol at all.
 *
 * THE RENDER-LOOP DISCIPLINE IS BORROWED, THE DEPENDENCY IS NOT (section 11.14, Andy
 * 2026-08-09 - "worth learning from the pixijs.com folks"). Four rules, all of them
 * cheap and all of them essential:
 *
 *   1. ONE TICKER for every peer, not one per cursor. A frame measures the two
 *      rects ONCE and then writes N transforms.
 *   2. POOLED NODES. A peer that leaves returns its node to a free list; the next
 *      peer to arrive takes that same node back. A roster that churns - the normal
 *      pattern of a session where people come and go - allocates nothing after the
 *      first few joins, and never leaves detached nodes for the GC to sweep mid-drag.
 *   3. INTERPOLATE, NEVER EXTRAPOLATE (section 4.3, stated in the plan as a rule). The
 *      ticker renders the segment BETWEEN the last two samples, one sample-interval
 *      behind live. Extrapolation is what produces the rubber-band overshoot that
 *      makes a cursor look drunk when a frame is dropped, and the presence lane
 *      drops frames by construction (`maxRetransmits: 0`).
 *   4. TRANSFORM ONLY. Position is `translate3d`, so a moving cursor is a compositor
 *      job that never invalidates layout, never reflows the sidebar, and never
 *      touches the tool render beneath.
 *
 * WHEN IT STOPS. The ticker is not a heartbeat - it exists only while something is
 * moving, and "moving" is measured, not assumed: a frame re-arms only while some
 * peer still has a segment left to walk between its last two samples. A peer who
 * parks their pointer is painted at rest and the loop stands down, so a live roster
 * costs nothing once nobody is moving. It also stands down when the roster empties,
 * when every peer's cursor goes away, and (for free) when the tab is hidden, because
 * rAF simply stops being called. That last one matters: a backgrounded helper's tab
 * must cost nothing, and a timer-driven loop would keep burning.
 *
 * REDUCED MOTION (section 4.8). `prefersReducedMotion()` does not slow the cursor down, it
 * removes the moving thing entirely: no ticker is started at all, and each peer is
 * drawn as a STATIC dot at its newest sample, repainted only when a frame actually
 * arrives. A user who asked for less motion should not be handed six drifting
 * arrows; they still get to see where everyone is.
 *
 * NAMES ARE UNTRUSTED (section 11.21/section 11.23). A display name arrives over the wire from a
 * peer, so it is written with `textContent` and never interpolated into markup.
 *
 * IT CARRIES ITS OWN STYLESHEET, injected into `<head>` on first mount - the
 * `music-player.ts`/`neuro-dock.ts`/`collab-pill.ts` pattern for lazy chrome that
 * must cost a single-player build nothing. `styles/parts/collab.css` deliberately
 * owns only the `.collab-tile-*` family and says so in its own header: a shared
 * `parts/*.css` rule using one of these bare class names would be silently inert
 * wherever this component is mounted (an unlayered injected sheet beats every
 * `@layer`), and confusingly duplicate it everywhere else. So `.collab-canvas-layer`,
 * `.collab-cursor`, `.collab-cursor-arrow` and `.collab-cursor-label` are defined
 * below and nowhere else. The per-collaborator hue rides the `--collab-color` custom
 * property; every glyph size is `calc(<px> * var(--a11y-fs))`; RTL rides logical
 * properties. What stays INLINE is position rather than paint: the layer's
 * `position/inset/pointer-events` (a layer whose sheet somehow did not land must not
 * become a full-page click shield), the ticker's `transform`, and the still-mode
 * silhouette below.

 * overlays measure `getBoundingClientRect()` and rebase into the layer's own space,
 * and both re-anchor on scroll, on resize and on a ResizeObserver. A canvas ZOOM or
 * PAN fires none of the three: `views/tool-stage-nav.ts` applies both as a CSS
 * `transform` on `.tool-canvas-outer` and dispatches no event. A transform changes
 * no scroll offset, no window size, and - crucially - no observed BORDER BOX, so
 * ResizeObserver reports nothing. Every ring therefore stayed at its pre-zoom
 * position until an unrelated model change happened to repaint it. Cursors hid it,
 * because their rAF ticker re-measures every frame; under `prefersReducedMotion()`
 * there is no ticker and they were stranded too.
 *
 * A MutationObserver on the `style`/`class` attributes of the chain between the
 * measured element and the layer's host is the precise answer: it is exactly the
 * set of boxes a transform can move the overlay relative to, it costs nothing while
 * nothing moves, and it needs no cooperation from (or import of) the stage-nav
 * controller. `stopAt` is EXCLUDED - a transform on the host moves the layer and the
 * canvas together, so there is nothing to re-anchor.
 *
 * Returns a disposer; a document with no MutationObserver (or no chain) yields a
 * no-op, because presence chrome must never be the thing that fails a mount.
