/**
 * The back pill - the "← Tools" control that used to be hand-written in every
 * view that has one (Dashboard, Verify, Profile, /pro, /start, the component
 * library, full-screen and sidebar tools, multi-edit).
 *
 * Two things were wrong with the hand-written copies, and this module fixes
 * both in one place:
 *
 * 1. They were LIES. Each was a hardcoded `<a href="#/">Tools</a>` - it always
 *    said "Tools" and always teleported to the gallery, no matter where you had
 *    actually come from. Opening the Dashboard from a Projects folder and
 *    pressing back dumped you in the gallery. Now the pill reads the view you
 *    last left (lib/back-nav.ts, already fed by the router) and both NAMES and
 *    RETURNS to it - "← Campaign assets", "← QR Code" - falling back to
 *    "← Home" → the gallery only when there is no previous view, i.e. you
 *    opened the URL directly. It also behaves like a back button: when a real
 *    history entry sits behind us it calls history.back() rather than pushing
 *    another entry, so back-back-back doesn't build a zig-zag stack.
 *
 * 2. They were MISALIGNED. The pill sat at its own top offset with its own
 *    padding while the top-right chrome cluster (.gallery-topright - the
 *    filter/history/language FABs and the profile pill) sat at another, so the
 *    two ends of the top row never lined up. The pill now shares the cluster's
 *    box metrics and offsets (see .tools-home / .tools-home.home-full in
 *    styles/parts/components.css + tool.css) and draws a stroked Lucide arrow
 *    instead of a text "←", so it reads as one of the same set.
 *
 * Call-sites render `backPillHtml()` and then wire `mountBackPill()`. Views
 * with unsaved work (the tool view, /pro) pass an `intercept` that takes over
 * the click and calls the supplied `go()` once the user has decided - that way
 * the confirm dialog and the pill never both navigate. `mountBackPill()` also
 * puts the always-Home FAB beside a tool-chrome pill that names anything other
 * than Home (addHomeEscape) - naming where you came from is the right pattern
 * until two tools name each other and the front door leaves the chrome.
