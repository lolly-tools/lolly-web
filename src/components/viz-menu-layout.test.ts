/**
 * The visualiser options menu's box model, pinned against the one bug it has actually had:
 * a preset list that collapsed to ZERO pixels.
 *
 * The menu is a flex column - the setting pill rows (mode, brand tint, colour scheme, cycle)
 * and the actions, then the search field, then the result list last. Every row but the list
 * is sized by its content, so the list is the only child the flex algorithm can shrink, and
 * it was authored `min-height: 0`. Once the fixed rows exceeded the menu's max-height - which
 * a brand with the full six colour schemes (MAX_SCHEMES, lib/viz-schemes.ts) did back when
 * each scheme was its own full-width row - the list absorbed the entire difference and
 * rendered 0px tall. Every preset was in the DOM; none was visible, so it read as "search
 * returns nothing". (The schemes are a wrapping pill row as of 2026-07-31, so that specific
 * pressure is gone; the floor is what makes the collapse impossible rather than unlikely.)
 *
 * jsdom does no layout, so this asserts on the DECLARATIONS instead - which is where both
 * halves of the bug lived:
 *   · the list must keep a non-zero floor, or it can be shrunk away again;
 *   · `.viz-menu` must declare its height ONCE. A second, later `.viz-menu { max-height … }`
 *     block (a leftover from the pre-search flat list) silently beat the search-list rule.
 *
 * The measured behaviour itself was verified in real Chrome: with 6 scheme rows the list
 * went 0px → 112px, and the menu's own scroller keeps the actions reachable.
