 * View-entrance cascade arming (platform & capabilities dashboards).
 *
 * The read-only dashboards reveal their top-level nodes — the "Tools" back-link,
 * the header band, then each section — as ONE staggered wave, so the page reads
 * as a single settle instead of the header snapping in while the cards cascade
 * underneath it. The CSS (app.css, gated behind
 * `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`) owns the animation; this
 * only ARMS it: add `.is-entering` to the view and an inline `--enter-i` ordinal
 * to each node, then remove both once the wave has finished so it never replays
 * when the user later expands a <details> section.
 *
 * MUST be called synchronously right after the view's innerHTML is assigned (no
 * await in between): the browser paints after the current task, so as long as
 * `.is-entering` is set in the same task the FIRST paint already carries the
 * hidden `from` state — there's no frame where the nodes flash in at full
 * opacity before jumping to 0.
