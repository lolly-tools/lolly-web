 * org/collab-protocol - the WORK-COLLAB wire protocol (plan 100 §7, wave 3.1).
 *
 * Types + pure helpers only: no socket, no DOM, no module state. This file is the
 * shell's written-down copy of the gateway contract implemented in lolly-work
 * (`server/src/collab/gateway.ts` + `rooms.ts`, its plans/14). Every frame shape,
 * close code and cap below has been RECONCILED against that implementation - where
 * a field name or a number is essential, the server file and symbol that owns it
 * is named beside it, so the next drift is a diff rather than a rediscovery.
 *
 * The endpoint: `wss://<instance-base>/ws/collab/<sessionId>`.
 *
 *   client → server   {t:'join', opVersion}
 *                     {t:'ops', ops}                   ← at most MAX_OPS_PER_FRAME
 *                     {t:'presence', frame}
 *                     {t:'leave'}
 *
 *   server → client   {t:'join-ack', roster, docState, serverClock, opVersion,
 *                                    you, notice?, unsynced?}
 *                     {t:'ops', from, ops}             ← peers only; never echoed to the sender
 *                     {t:'presence', from, frame}
 *                     {t:'peer-join', member}
 *                     {t:'peer-leave', id}             ← the CONNECTION id, not a user id
 *                     {t:'error', code, message, inputs?}  ← sender-only (input-locked veto)
 *                     + typed close codes (COLLAB_CLOSE)
 *
 * ── AUTH IS A COOKIE, SO THE GATEWAY IS SAME-ORIGIN ONLY ─────────────────────
 *
 * The upgrade carries no token: the gateway reads the instance's session cookie off
 * the upgrade request and refuses before the handshake (gateway.ts's `readPrincipal`
 * + `refuse(socket, 401)`). That cookie is `SameSite=Lax` (lolly-work
 * `server/src/iam/sessions.ts`), and a browser does NOT attach a Lax cookie to a
 * CROSS-SITE WebSocket handshake - so a shell pointed at a remote instance base
 * (lib/instance.ts) cannot authenticate at all, and the failure arrives as a bare
 * abnormal close with nothing to diagnose it by. Adding the origin to CSP
 * `connect-src` does not fix that; nothing on the client can.
 *
 * So the derivation REFUSES a cross-origin endpoint outright (`isCrossOriginSocket`
 * below, applied in org/collab-provider.ts's `endpoint()`), and the session ends
 * with a stated reason instead of an unexplained reconnect loop. A hosted work
 * collab on a remote base needs a server-side answer first (a same-site cookie
 * attribute the deployment can actually set, or a one-time ticket in the URL) - 
 * plan 100 §7 gains that line before the remote case ships.
 *
 * CSP (plan 100 §11.8 records that WebRTC is invisible to CSP; a WebSocket is NOT).
 * `connect-src 'self'` - what vercel.json and deploy/docker/nginx.conf both ship - 
 * covers the same-origin `wss:` upgrade this module allows, because 'self' matches
 * the page's own origin across the http→ws scheme pair. Nothing else is reachable,
 * which is also why the CSP egress inventory gains no new host for this feature.
 *
 * SERVER FRAMES ARE UNTRUSTED INPUT. Every field on a `server → client` frame is
 * declared optional here on purpose: the parser (`parseServerFrame`) proves only
 * that a frame is a JSON object with a known `t`, and each handler validates what it
 * actually reads. Ops get a structural gate (`isCanvasOp`) - deliberately NOT the
 * deep one: the ajv `validateCanvasOp` + shared op guard is separate concurrent work
 * (plan 100 §11.21), and the integration must route inbound ops through it once it
 * lands. See the concerns note in org/collab-provider.ts.
