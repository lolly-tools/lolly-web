 * org/team-session-origin.ts - where a mounted tool CAME FROM, when it came from a
 * team session on the instance (plans/100 §7; the stitch-2 gap named in
 * `lib/collab-launch.ts`'s `CollabLaunchContext.sessionId`).
 *
 * ── The gap this closes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The Team-projects modal opens a session by FETCHING it and rewriting the hash to
 * `#/tool/<id>?<serialised state>` (`views/projects.ts`'s `openTeamSession`). That
 * rewrite is a faithful working copy and a deliberate amnesiac: the instance's id for
 * the session survives nowhere in the route, the runtime, or the slot, so by the time
 * the Share dialog builds a `CollabLaunchContext` the id is genuinely unknowable from
 * anything the tool view holds - and the `'work'` opener, whose whole prerequisite is
 * that id (a work collab is a room keyed by it), could only refuse.
 *
 * So the id travels beside the navigation instead of inside it: a one-shot stash armed
 * by the open and spent by the mount it was armed for. The same shape as the other
 * hand-offs that cross this exact seam - `lib/collab-live-mount.ts`'s
 * `carryMountState`/`takeCarriedMountState` and the drop router's stash-then-route - 
 * and for the same reason: the route is a lossy encoder, and some facts about a mount
 * are not input values and have no business being serialised into a shareable link.
 * A team session's id is one of them: it is an instance-side identifier, not part of
 * the creative state, and putting it in the URL would make it a thing users copy.
 *
 * ── Two states, both deliberately small ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  - `pending` - armed by {@link rememberTeamSessionOrigin} in the window between the
 *    open and the mount. Spent by the FIRST {@link consumeTeamSessionOrigin}, whether
 *    or not it matches: a mount of a different tool means the navigation this stash
 *    was armed for never happened, and a stash that outlives its window is exactly how
 *    an unrelated later mount inherits someone else's session id.
 *  - `active` - what that consume promoted, for the life of the mount that consumed
 *    it. Read (never taken) by {@link activeTeamSessionOrigin}, which requires the
 *    caller to name the tool it is asking about, so an origin can only ever answer for
 *    the tool it belongs to.
 *
 * ── The honesty rules (why this file is so cautious) ───────────────────────────
 *
 * The failure mode worth designing against is not "the id is missing" - the opener
 * already has an honest sentence for that - it is **an id that is present and wrong**,
 * which silently opens a room on somebody else's session. Hence:
 *
 *  1. **Every mount consumes.** A non-matching consume clears BOTH states, so a stash
 *     can never survive into the mount after next, and an origin never outlives the
 *     mount that earned it.
 *  2. **A remount never resurrects one.** The collab adoption path force-remounts the
 *     same tool (`lib/collab-live-mount.ts`), and an acceptor's remount is a document
 *     seeded by a PEER - the same tool id, a completely different session. Since the
 *     stash is already spent, that remount consumes nothing and clears `active`. The
 *     origin is lost rather than re-asserted; losing it costs an honest refusal, and
 *     keeping it would cost a wrong room.
 *  3. **The mount releases it on teardown** ({@link releaseTeamSessionOrigin}), so a
 *     Share dialog opened somewhere else later - the Projects view can share a LOCAL
 *     session of the same tool - cannot read an origin from a mount that is gone.
 *  4. **Reloading the tab loses it**, and that is accepted, not worked around. Nothing
 *     here is persisted: `sessionStorage` would survive a reload and thereby survive
 *     every guarantee above. The durable path to a work collab is the invite deep link,
 *     which carries the id in the message (§7 item 9) - this stash only makes the
 *     in-app "I am already looking at that session" path work.
 *
 * Module state, not a DOM/storage/network surface: this file imports nothing, which is
 * why `views/` may statically import it without dragging the control plane onto the
 * boot path. It lives under `org/` because the fact it carries is control-plane
 * awareness - an id only an instance issues - and the generic seams it threads between
 * (`lib/share-sections.ts`, `lib/collab-launch.ts`) stay product-neutral by not
 * learning about it. `org/collab-share.ts` is the only reader.
