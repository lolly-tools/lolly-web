/**
 * org/collab-share.ts — the "Work collab" section of the Share dialog
 * (plans/100 §0/§7, Track B: org rooms on the optional control plane).
 *
 * Loaded lazily by src/org/index.ts's member branch, mirroring org/share-links.ts
 * one section over: registered through the generic lib/share-sections.ts seam so
 * the dialog itself stays control-plane-unaware, with the heavy work kept out of
 * the boot chunk. This wave (plans/100 §13 wave 3.1) lands the row + gating ONLY —
 * the ceremony/join UI that actually starts a work collab is a later wave, so the
 * row renders nothing anywhere today.
 *
 * Two independent gates, both required:
 *   - `canJoinCollab()` (org/collab-config.ts) — this instance's control plane must
 *     grant the caller `collab.join`. Absent on every instance until the server
 *     ships the bits (plans/100 §7.3), which is where org/index.ts's own inline
 *     bail (its own `can['collab.join']` check, ahead of even loading this module)
 *     does the same test for the common "no control plane" case cheaply.
 *   - a `'work'` opener registered in lib/collab-launch.ts — the actual ceremony/
 *     join dialog, which arrives with the invite UX (plans/100 §7 item 9). Nothing
 *     registers one yet, so today this gate alone is enough to keep the row absent
 *     even on an instance that DOES grant `collab.join`.
 *
 * Row copy follows plans/100 §0's naming: "Work collab" heading, "Start a collab"
 * verb — never "rooms"/"multiplayer". `announce()` on a successful open, exactly
 * like org/share-links.ts's rows; a missing/throwing opener degrades to silence
 * (openCollabLaunch's own tolerance — see lib/collab-launch.ts).
 *
 * ── The session id (the one thing this row adds to the context) ────────────────
 *
 * A work collab is a room keyed by the id the INSTANCE holds for the session, and
 * the tool view has no such id: the Team-projects open rewrites to `#/tool/<id>?…`,
 * a working copy that has forgotten where it came from. `org/team-session-origin.ts`
 * carries that fact beside the navigation, and this row is its only reader — which
 * is why the id enters the `CollabLaunchContext` HERE, in the one builder that is
 * already control-plane-aware, rather than in the generic `ShareSectionContext` the
 * dialog hands every section. The neutral seam stays neutral; a plain deployment,
 * and every ordinary local session on a governed one, produce a context with no such
 * field at all.
