 * The control-plane PROBE, and the boot entry point that stands in front of the

 *
 * `org/index.ts` documents the seam; this file is the first two steps of it, split
 * out so a deployment with no control plane - which is every public one - never
 * loads the other 47 KB. Boot calls {@link initOrgProbeFirst}, which answers the
 * dormant case from a localStorage negative cache or one tolerant 404 and returns
 * `null` without ever importing the rest; only a deployment that actually
 * answers `/api/auth/config` pays for the session/gate/policy/injectable code
 * (plans/155 WP-3).
 *
 * WHY THE PROBE ITSELF STAYS EAGER. It has to run during boot - the gate decides
 * whether a view mounts at all - so making the fetch lazy would only move the cost
 * to a chunk request in front of first paint, which is the opposite of the point.
 * What is deferred is the code that INTERPRETS a control plane's answer.
 *
 * The tolerance contract is unchanged, and everything depends on it: nothing throws to
 * boot, every failure reads as dormancy, and the negative cache is an acceleration
 * only - never a source of truth, and self-healing once its TTL expires.
