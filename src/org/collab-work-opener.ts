 * org/collab-work-opener - the `'work'` slot of `lib/collab-launch.ts`, and the inbox
 * affordance that joins one from an invite (plan 100 section 7 items 9 + 11, section 12 Q3; wave 3.3).
 *
 * The Track B sibling of `collab/private-opener.ts`, one track over. Read that file's
 * header first: the two are deliberately the same shape (an opener registered into a
 * named slot, the heavy half behind a dynamic import, the live session handed to
 * `lib/collab-mount.ts` and nowhere else), and everything below is the delta a SERVER
 * room brings - no ceremony, no SDP, no pairing. A work collab is joined, not agreed:
 * the room already exists, keyed by the session id the instance holds.
 *
 * ── The one chain, stated once ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   createWorkCollabProvider(sessionId)   the ws pipe        org/collab-provider.ts
 *     → createWorkCollabHandle(provider)  the shape change   org/collab-handle.ts
 *       → deliverCollabConnection({role:'member', …})        lib/collab-mount.ts
 *
 * Both entry points below funnel into exactly that, so there is one way a work collab
 * starts. The mount takes it from there - it registers the session source, seeds the
 * copy and takes the user to the tool (`lib/collab-mount.ts`'s header). This module
 * therefore navigates nowhere and touches no runtime: doing either here would be a
 * second half-implementation of the adoption contract.
 *
 * ── WHY IT WAITS FOR `'live'` BEFORE BUILDING THE HANDLE ───────────────────────
 *
 * `org/collab-handle.ts` states the rule and the reason: `createCollabSession` picks
 * its adapter wrapper ONCE, at construction, from `handle.role`, and the gateway does
 * not assign the seat until the `join-ack`. A handle built while the provider still
 * holds its pre-join `'writer'` default hands an OBSERVER the writer wrapper for the
 * life of the session - survivable (the provider refuses their ops on its own) but it
 * means their local doc records edits the room never saw. Waiting costs one promise and
 * removes the whole class. It is also when `self.name` is known.
 *
 * The wait is bounded ({@link CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS} - section 7.11 targets join-to-interactive
 * under 3 s, so several times that is already a failure) and every exit that is not
 * `'live'` closes the provider. A socket left open behind a failure message is a room
 * the user has silently joined.
 *
 * ── HONEST FAILURE IS THE POINT OF THE FETCH ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The invite path fetches the session BEFORE it connects, through
 * `org/session-source.ts`'s status-carrying `fetchTeamSession`. Not to warm a cache:
 * an invite outlives the thing it invites you to, and the three ways that happens need
 * three different sentences - the session was deleted (410), your access was revoked
 * (403), or it is not there at all (404). A ws connect answers all three as "the socket
 * closed", which is how a product ends up telling someone to check their network when
 * an administrator removed them from a project.
 *
 * What the fetch does NOT do is seed the copy. `CollabConnection.seed` is URL-mode
 * parameters, and it is documented as absent for a `'member'`: the server owns this
 * session's state and delivers it in the `join-ack` snapshot, so handing the mount a
 * second, older copy of it - in a different currency, fetched over a different
 * connection - is two sources of truth for one document. The fetch's other product is
 * the SERVER's `toolId`, which is section 7.11's preload (the mount can start loading the tool
 * while the handshake completes) and is the one fact the invite could have gone stale on.
 *
 * ── WHAT GATES WHAT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  - STARTING one (`openWorkCollab`) needs `collab.edit`: you are proposing that other
 *    people co-edit this session, which is an editing act.
 *  - JOINING one (`joinWorkCollabFromInvite`, and whether the invite action renders at
 *    all) needs `collab.join`. Absent or false ⇒ NO action element - the message still
 *    reads as ordinary text, because an invite you cannot act on is still news you are
 *    entitled to.
 *  - Both bits default false and are read LIVE, on every press, through
 *    `org/collab-config.ts`. Checking inside rather than around the registration is the
 *    house pattern (`collab/private-opener.ts`'s note on the flag): policy that changes
 *    mid-session takes effect without a reload, and the cost of an inert registration is
 *    one closure.
 *
 * ── Copy ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every user-visible string is in {@link STRINGS}, and every read of it goes through
 * `tRaw()` - the same convention `collab/join-route.ts` uses, and the reason the map is
 * a corpus source in scripts/translate.ts's COLLAB_SOURCES. The copy rides the lazy
 * `collab` namespace (i18n.ts) because that is what this surface is: a work collab is
 * the server-room half of the same feature, and its sentences are the same register.
 * Both async entry points await `loadNamespace('collab')` before they can produce a
 * message, and the one synchronous painter (`buildCollabInviteAction`) re-stamps its
 * label when the namespace lands - an unloaded namespace renders English, exactly like
 * a missing key. Server-supplied text never reaches the DOM from here at all.

// ── Registration ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Register the `'work'` opener (last-wins), plus the `collab.edit` policy the neutral
 * availability seam asks for the work track; returns the unregister fn for both.
 *
 * Called by `org/index.ts`'s member branch on an instance that grants `collab.join`,
 * beside the provider-factory registration it depends on. The capability re-check
 * lives INSIDE the opener (see the header), so this registration says only "this
 * instance offers work collabs", never "this member may start one".
 *
 * The policy is the same statement in the other direction. `lib/collab-availability.ts`
 * (plans/108 Phase 1) decides where a surface may offer a work collab, and one of its
 * three conditions is `collab.edit` - a control-plane grant only `org/` may read. So it
 * is handed over as a live callback rather than imported, which keeps the seam neutral
 * and keeps the answer fresh: policy that changes mid-session takes effect without a
 * reload, exactly like the opener's own press-time checks. It travels with the opener
 * because a work collab needs both facts or neither.
 *
 * `CollabOpener` is fire-and-forget, so the outcome is announced rather than returned:
 * the share row's own `announce('Starting a collab')` is a promise this keeps or
 * corrects a moment later.
