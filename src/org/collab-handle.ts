 * org/collab-handle — the Track B ADAPTER: one work-collab provider, seen as the
 * `CollabSessionHandle` a mounted tool actually needs (plan 100 §7, wave 3.2).
 *
 * `org/collab-provider.ts` speaks the gateway's wire; `lib/collab-session.ts`
 * composes presence, colours and op plumbing for a mount. Neither imports the other,
 * deliberately — the provider's header says so, and `collab/rtc-transport.ts` says
 * the same thing for Track A ("a transport must not depend on a session"). THIS is
 * the file where both may legitimately be named at once, and it holds nothing else:
 * no socket, no roster policy, no UI. Everything below is a shape change.
 *
 * The map, which the provider's header already wrote down and this file makes real:
 *
 *   adapter       → `provider.adapter`                         (identical type)
 *   role          → `provider.state().role`, read LIVE         (identical union)
 *   presenceIn    → the provider's `presence` events, plus the roster seed
 *   sendPresence  → `provider.sendPresence`                    (verbatim)
 *   events        → the provider's `state` events, status-mapped
 *   close         → `provider.close()`
 *   self          → this device's collab client id + the SSO display name
 *   hostClientId  → ABSENT, and that is the answer (see below)
 *   peerRole      → the join-ack roster, looked up by principal
 *
 * ── ROLE IS LIVE, AND WHEN YOU BUILD THE HANDLE MATTERS ───────────────────────
 *
 * The gateway assigns the seat and says so in `join-ack.you.role`; the provider
 * already reads it (and fails closed — absent is never a grant). So `role` here is a
 * GETTER over `provider.state().role`, never a snapshot and never re-derived: there
 * is exactly one place that decides what this client may do, and it is the ack.
 *
 * A handle can be built before the ack (the mount seam,
 * `lib/collab-session-source.ts`, is synchronous), and `state().role` then still
 * reads its pre-join default of `'writer'`. Every LIVE read corrects itself —
 * `CollabSessionState.role` is rebuilt from `handle.role` on each notify, so the
 * pill's observer banner is right the moment the ack lands. ONE read does not:
 * `createCollabSession` picks its adapter wrapper once, at construction
 * (`handle.role === 'observer' ? observerAdapter(...) : ...`), so a session built
 * before the ack keeps the writer wrapper for its whole life.
 *
 * That is survivable rather than dangerous, and it is worth being precise about why:
 * the provider refuses an observer's ops on its own — `sendOps` and `enqueue` both
 * return early on `role === 'observer'` — so nothing an observer types can reach the
 * wire or the durable outbox by this route. What is left is that their LOCAL
 * convergence doc records edits the room never saw, until the next `join-ack`
 * rebuilds it from the snapshot (`seedFrom`). So: **build the handle, and the
 * session, once the provider reports `'live'`** — which is also when `self.name` is
 * known (below). The wrapper is not duplicated here on purpose; observer semantics
 * have one owner (`collab-session.ts`), and a second suppressor in the transport
 * adapter is how two half-answers to the same question start disagreeing.
 *
 * ── PRESENCE: ALIGN, NEVER RE-STAMP ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The provider forwards the presence payload verbatim and says why: the lane's SHAPE
 * belongs to the presence engine, not the transport. Two shapes legitimately ride it
 * (`CollabPresencePayload`) and this module is where the choice is finally made:
 *
 *  - a full `PresenceFrame` (`lib/collab-presence.ts`) — what every Lolly shell in a
 *    collab actually sends, carrying the sender's own `from` and per-sender `seq`.
 *    It is passed through UNTOUCHED. Re-stamping `from` with the gateway's frame
 *    `from` would be actively wrong: that is the sender's CONNECTION id, while the
 *    roster key the whole presence engine (and the focus overlay, and the colour
 *    assignment) is built on is the per-device client id. Re-stamping `seq` would be
 *    worse — it is the ONLY thing that resolves an unordered lane (§11.5), and it is
 *    the sender's counter, not ours.
 *  - a bare `Presence`/`Awareness` (what `CanvasSyncAdapter.presence` takes, which a
 *    handle is explicitly allowed to implement `sendPresence` as). It carries no
 *    envelope, so one is minted: `from` is the gateway's connection id, and `seq` is
 *    a locally minted counter kept strictly above every seq already seen for that
 *    sender. Minting is sound HERE and would not be on Track A: a WebSocket is
 *    ordered and reliable, so arrival order *is* send order and a local counter
 *    carries exactly the information a wire seq would.
 *
 * Anything else — a non-object, an array, an object with neither a `state` envelope
 * nor a `userId` — is dropped. The payload is untrusted input off a socket.
 *
 * ── ROSTER SEEDING, AND THE DEADLOCK IT EXISTS TO BREAK ───────────────────────
 *
 * The `join-ack` roster is the only thing that tells a joiner who is already in the
 * room, and it must reach the presence engine or the room can sit MUTUALLY SILENT:
 * the engine sends nothing at all while its roster is empty (§4.7 — not "cheap when
 * alone", *nothing*), so a lone incumbent is silent, and a joiner whose engine also
 * knows nobody is silent too. Two people, one room, neither visible, forever.
 *
 * So each roster entry is surfaced through `presenceIn` as a synthetic PLACEHOLDER
 * frame. That gives the engine a peer, which starts its lifecycle and flushes our
 * own state, which the incumbent receives — and now they have a peer, and answer.
 * The handshake completes in one round trip and nobody had to invent a "hello".
 *
 * The wire carries no per-device client id for a roster entry, so a placeholder is
 * keyed by the CONNECTION id (`RosterEntry.id`, the same id `peer-leave` names),
 * falling back to the principal. That is a different key from the one the same
 * person's real frames arrive under, and the seq rules make the difference harmless:
 *
 *  - a placeholder is seeded at `seq` {@link ROSTER_SEED_SEQ} = 0. The engine admits
 *    a frame only when its `seq` is strictly greater than the one it holds, and its
 *    own frames start at 1 — so 0 is the one value that can never mask a live frame,
 *    in either direction. A gateway that ever DID key its roster by device id needs
 *    no special case: the peer's own `seq: 1` frame simply supersedes the
 *    placeholder in place.
 *  - when a real frame arrives from a device we have not linked yet, the placeholder
 *    standing for that principal is retired with a `state: null` leave frame at
 *    {@link ROSTER_RETIRE_SEQ}. The retirement is emitted AFTER the real frame, so
 *    the two rows never both exist across a paint — the engine deletes and adds
 *    inside one synchronous burst, and only the settled roster is ever rendered.
 *  - a placeholder whose roster row disappears is retired the same way, on the state
 *    event that dropped it. That one may be re-seeded later (a genuine rejoin);
 *    a placeholder retired because a real frame replaced it never is.
 *
 * THE SAFETY PROPERTY THAT MAKES ALL OF THIS ACCEPTABLE: a placeholder never
 * refreshes and is never flagged away, so the engine's own TTL sweep evicts it
 * within 30 s no matter what. No bookkeeping mistake here can produce a permanent
 * ghost — the worst case is a stale row for one TTL. That is the bound on every
 * case this file cannot resolve exactly, and there is one: a principal holding
 * several connections (two tabs, a phone — the wire explicitly allows it) is matched
 * by principal alone, so a reconnect that mints a new connection id while the old
 * device is already linked leaves one placeholder standing until the sweep takes it.
 *
 * ── THERE IS NO HOST ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `hostClientId` is left ABSENT, and its absence is a statement rather than a gap.
 * Track A is asymmetric by design (§6.2a: the inviter owns the session, holds the
 * persistence, and is the catch-up source), which is what lets a nameless peer read
 * as "Host". A work collab has no such peer: the SERVER owns persistence and
 * authority (§7.10 — the availability guarantee Track A structurally cannot make),
 * so every participant is a member of a room. `createCollabSession` reads the
 * absence exactly that way — `isHost` is `hostClientId !== undefined && … === id`,
 * so it is false for everyone and no "Host" tag is rendered. The invitee ordinals
 * fall out the same way and stay unused in practice: identity here comes from SSO
 * (§7.8), so participants have real names and are never numbered.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  - **Guarding the ops lane.** As of 2026-08-09 this adapter DOES republish inbound
 *    ops, as {@link WorkCollabSessionHandle.opsIn} — the same member name and the same
 *    `CollabStream` shape Track A's `RtcCollabHandle` publishes, so `views/tool-collab.ts`
 *    has ONE wire for both tracks instead of a per-track branch. That is a shape change
 *    (this file's whole job) and nothing more: the stream is a verbatim forward of the
 *    provider's `{ kind: 'ops' }` events. What is still emphatically NOT here is the
 *    GUARD. Those ops are untrusted input and must pass the shared op guard
 *    (`collab/op-guard.ts`, plan 100 §11.21) before they reach the runtime — the
 *    provider's structural gate (`isCanvasOp`) is an envelope check, not the boundary —
 *    and that happens exactly once, inside `session.applyRemotePatch`, which the MOUNT
 *    calls. Guarding here would mean this file knew about the tool's input model, which
 *    is precisely what it must not know, and would put a second copy of the policy on
 *    one of the two tracks.
 *  - **Colour slots.** `self.colorIndex` stays absent unless a caller supplies one.
 *    The roster carries a `color` HEX from the server's palette and no index, and
 *    inventing a slot from it would be a guess; the session already handles an
 *    unrecognised hex honestly (claim it if it is in our palette, otherwise
 *    re-derive by roster order — §11.16).
 *  - **Reconnect policy, retries, the outbox.** All the provider's. This adapter
 *    reports states and never acts on them.
