 * org/collab-provider — the WORK-COLLAB client (plan 100 §7, wave 3.1).
 *
 * A thin WebSocket pipe speaking `CanvasOp` + presence frames to the instance's
 * collab gateway, wrapped so it satisfies `CanvasSyncAdapter` — the same stable
 * contract type the private-collab (P2P) provider satisfies, so the shell has ONE
 * collab client surface and only the transport object differs (plan 100 §7, last
 * paragraph: "No yjs in the browser — ever"). Convergence on this side is the
 * dependency-free `ReferenceCanvasDoc` from `@lolly-tools/core`; the SERVER owns the
 * Yjs document authority.
 *
 * DORMANT BY DEFAULT, and that is the contract. Nothing in this file runs unless an
 * instance's org-config grants `collab.join` AND something opens a team session — see
 * "What the wave-1 integration must call" below. With no instance there is no
 * control plane, no org-config, no registration, and no import: `org/index.ts` reaches
 * this module through a dynamic `import()` inside its member branch, so a build with
 * no control plane never even loads it.
 *
 * ── What the wave-1 integration must call ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A collab is per-SESSION, but nothing at boot can yet tell that a given tool mount
 * came from a team project rather than a local slot — so this module registers a
 * FACTORY, not a provider, and the last wire is left for the integration that owns
 * "this mount is a team session". That integration is:
 *
 *   1. `const make = getWorkCollabFactory();`   // undefined ⇒ not offered here
 *   2. `const collab = make(sessionId, { guard: createOpGuard({ inputs: runtime.getModel() }) });`
 *      `await collab.connect();`
 *   3. `const handle = createWorkCollabHandle(collab, { name });`      // org/collab-handle.ts
 *      `const session = createCollabSession({ handle, runtime, … });`  // lib/collab-session.ts
 *      `collab.on(e => { if (e.kind === 'ops') session.applyRemotePatch(e.ops); });`
 *
 * and, on unmount, `session.close()` (which detaches the plumbing and closes the
 * handle, which closes `collab`). The `role` on `session.state()` is what the UI
 * gates writes on ('observer' ⇒ read-only chrome); `session.state().peers` is what
 * the wave-1 presence UI paints from.
 *
 * STEP 3's `collab.on(e => … session.applyRemotePatch(e.ops))` — NEVER
 * `plumbing?.applyRemotePatch(e.ops)` directly — is not a style preference, and an
 * earlier revision of this header got it backwards. `session.applyRemotePatch` is
 * where `createCollabSession` runs the manifest-aware op guard (plan 100 §11.21);
 * `plumbing.applyRemotePatch` is the UNGUARDED door beneath it, and `org/collab-
 * handle.ts`'s own header says the same thing for the same wire ("Those ops are
 * untrusted input and must pass the shared op guard … BEFORE they reach the
 * runtime"). Two contradictory instructions for one wire is worse than either
 * alone, so if you find a THIRD one, this file's header is wrong and `collab-
 * handle.ts`'s is right.
 *
 * STEP 2's `guard` is a SEPARATE, earlier gate — this file's own, over the raw
 * socket frame, before `doc` (this file's `CanvasSyncAdapter`, `=== handle.adapter`
 * verbatim per `org/collab-handle.ts`'s header) can absorb a write step 3's guard
 * would have refused. See `WorkCollabOptions.guard`'s own comment for why a SECOND
 * guard is not redundant with the session's: `doc` is what `lib/collab-plumbing.ts`'s
 * `buildPatch` reads back out (`ConvergedRead`) the moment ANY later op — including
 * one step 3 admits without complaint — touches the same key, so an unguarded write
 * here is promoted into the runtime regardless of what step 3 decided about it.
 * Omitting step 2's `guard` degrades to a floor (schema-valid, safe-integer clock,
 * no forbidden key — no value-size cap, no manifest whitelist) rather than the
 * boundary, exactly as `collab/rtc-handle.ts`'s own optional `guard` does for
 * Track A; it does not remove the vulnerability step 3 alone would still leave.
 *
 * The factory registry lives here rather than in a neutral `lib/` seam on purpose:
 * the tidy-surface rule keeps control-plane awareness inside `org/`, and there is no
 * consumer yet to justify a second registry. When wave 1 wires a consumer, promoting
 * these three functions to a `lib/work-collab.ts` seam (the `lib/session-source.ts`
 * shape) is a rename, not a redesign.
 *
 * ── Reducing to `CollabSessionHandle` (lib/collab-session.ts) ────────────────
 *
 * That module is the composition every collab reduces to, and it names this file as
 * Track B's producer. The map, so the integration is mechanical rather than a
 * redesign (nothing is imported from it here — it is a sibling wave, and coupling
 * the transport to it would make each churn the other):
 *
 *   adapter       → `handle.adapter`                    (identical type)
 *   role          → `handle.state().role`               (identical union)
 *   presenceIn    → a stream over `on()`'s 'presence' events
 *   sendPresence  → `handle.sendPresence(frame)`         (verbatim pass-through)
 *   events        → a stream over `on()`'s 'state' events, mapping
 *                   'idle'|'connecting'|'joining' → 'connecting', 'live' → 'live',
 *                   'reconnecting' → 'reconnecting', 'closed' → 'closed'
 *   close         → `handle.close()`
 *   self          → the org session's display name (SSO) + this device's clientId
 *   hostClientId  → absent: a work collab has no inviter-owns-it asymmetry; the
 *                   server owns persistence (§7.10), which is the whole point
 *   peerRole      → look up `state().roster` by userId; undefined is honest
 *
 * Presence deliberately does NOT go through `adapter.presence` on this path: the
 * wave-1 engine's frame carries the per-sender `seq` an unordered lane needs
 * (§11.5), and `CanvasSyncAdapter.presence` only takes a bare `Awareness`.
 *
 * ── The outbox, and how an entry is retired ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Plan 100 §7.10 is the availability guarantee Track A structurally cannot make:
 * every client can crash at once and the room recovers from the server snapshot plus
 * everyone's outbox. The client half is here — local ops persist to IndexedDB,
 * replay after `join-ack`, and the gateway dedups per client by highest accepted
 * Lamport clock (rooms.ts `applyOps`), so a replay is idempotent.
 *
 * THE GATEWAY SENDS NO RECEIPT. This is the fact the whole design turns on, and it
 * was checked, not assumed:
 *
 *   - `ops` is broadcast to PEERS only (`applyOps`: `if (peer.id === from.id)
 *     continue`), so a writer never sees its own ops come back;
 *   - `join-ack.serverClock` is the ROOM-WIDE maximum accepted clock, not this
 *     client's — a peer alone can carry it past everything we ever minted, so
 *     retiring anything by it would drop ops the gateway never received;
 *   - the per-client `highestClock` map the gateway dedups against is not published.
 *
 * So an entry is retired by one of:
 *
 *   (a) ECHO — an inbound `ops` frame carrying `(origin.client, origin.clock)` of
 *       ours. Exact and needs no interpretation. Inert against today's gateway (see
 *       above); kept because it costs nothing and is the rule the moment a gateway
 *       does echo.
 *
 *   (b) SECOND DELIVERY — the entry was written to a socket on an EARLIER
 *       connection, and this connection's `join-ack` replay has now written it
 *       again, to a room the gateway has just re-hydrated from persistence (plus any
 *       crash recovery). A drop is exactly when a server-side loss becomes visible,
 *       and the replay is exactly what repairs it; holding the entry past a second
 *       successful delivery defends only against two consecutive losses, and costs
 *       an outbox that never drains and a `pending` count that is never zero.
 *
 * Nothing is retired on its FIRST write to a socket, and nothing is retired by a
 * watermark. An entry never written to a socket (typed while reconnecting, or loaded
 * from a previous run) survives its first replay and drains on the next one.
 *
 * `pending` counts entries not yet written to any socket — the honest "your edits
 * have not reached anyone" number a UI can gate on. `queued` is the whole journal.
 * When the cap bites, DELIVERED entries are shed first and silently (dropping them
 * costs replay depth, not an edit); only shedding an undelivered entry is a loss,
 * and that is what raises `outbox-overflow`.
 *
 * ── What never happens ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  - An OBSERVER never sends an ops frame and never queues one. Role comes from the
 *    gateway's `join-ack.you.role`, and an ack that declares no role at all seats us
 *    as an observer — absent is never a grant. It is checked again locally against
 *    `isCompatibleOpVersion` so a gateway that forgot still cannot make us write ops
 *    it will reject. Presence is a different lane and stays open to observers (plan
 *    100 §7.5).
 *  - Our own ops are never re-emitted to the runtime. An echo is used for acking and
 *    then dropped, so a local edit cannot round-trip into a second apply.
 *  - An `ops` frame never exceeds the gateway's per-message cap. Both a live gesture
 *    and a full outbox replay go out through `chunkOps`, because exceeding it is not
 *    an error frame — the gateway CLOSES the socket (`CLOSE.OPS_RATE`).
 *  - A local edit is never queued after the session has ended. A typed close ends it
 *    as surely as `close()` does.
 *  - This device's Lamport clock never goes backwards across a reconnect. See
 *    `primeClock`: a re-minted `(client, clock)` pair is silently DISCARDED by the
 *    gateway's monotonic dedup, which in a quiet room means the user types and
 *    nothing ever reaches anyone.
 *  - No wall clock touches convergence (plan 100 §11.7): ordering is `(clock, client)`
 *    only. `Date.now()` appears nowhere in this file.
