/**
 * Mobile-app platform fit (plans/132, device-verified fixes 2026-08-22).
 * Tauri MOBILE webviews only - the browser PWA and the desktop shells are
 * untouched. Three corrections, each earned on a real phone:
 *
 * 1) Page pinch-zoom is disabled (Andy: it breaks the fixed chrome; zooming
 *    belongs to the surfaces that own it - the catalog preview and the canvas
 *    gestures). WKWebView honours user-scalable=no; Safari-the-browser ignores
 *    it for accessibility, but this is an app, whose text-size story is (3).
 * 2) env(safe-area-inset-*) fallback: the iOS 27 beta's WKWebView resolves the
 *    envs to 0 while drawing full-bleed, which put the back pill on top of the
 *    status clock. Probe env() through a live element; when it reads 0 on a
 *    notched iPhone, feed tokens.css's --safe-*-fb from the screen class
 *    (erring a few px generous - chrome sits a hair lower, never under glass).
 * 3) OS text size: iOS Dynamic Type does not reach web content, so probe the
 *    `-apple-system-body` font (which DOES track it) and feed the ratio into
 *    the EXISTING --a11y-fs chrome multiplier - the export-safe scale
 *    (a11y-prefs: chrome-only, never the canvas). Capped at 1.5 - beyond that
 *    the chrome needs real reflow work, not scaling. When the in-app largeText
 *    pref is also on, the larger of the two wins.

  // silently boot as if that instance had no control plane. So the probe hangs off
  // initInstanceBase(), which is memoised (catalog/sync.ts awaits the same promise, so
  // this costs one shared IndexedDB read, not two) and never throws.
  //
  // On a Tauri shell the base has a SECOND source: the first-run instance sheet below,
  // whose whole job is to set it, and which cannot be known until the user answers. So
  // there the probe waits for that sheet - i.e. keeps the position it always had -
  // and starting initInstanceBase early is itself skipped, since its read would race
  // the sheet's setInstanceBase() write. Web/PWA never shows the sheet, and is where
