/**
 * Auto-cycling policy for a MilkDrop surface — shared by the Neurospicy dock and the
 * catalog's audio details modal so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * What lives here is the POLICY, not the rendering: which intervals are offered, what
 * the saved preference is, when cycling is suppressed, and the timer itself. What stays
 * with each caller is the part only it can know — which surfaces are live and what
 * "advance" means for it. That split is why this extracts cleanly: the dock cycles
 * presets AND colour schemes across two surfaces, the modal cycles one preset in one
 * canvas, and neither detail belongs in a timer.
 *
 * THE SUPPRESSION RULES ARE THE INTERESTING PART, and both were learned the hard way in
 * the dock:
 *
 *   A surface nobody can see must not cycle. A collapsed dock keeps its handle but its
 *   canvas stops being laid out, so the render loop retires — and `setPreset` on a
 *   renderer that is not drawing costs a full preset rebuild, every interval, forever.
 *
 *   Silence must not cycle. With no audio signal the field is static anyway, so rotating
 *   presets only churns the GPU behind a status note.
 *
 * Reduced motion turns cycling OFF by default rather than merely slowing it: an
 * unrequested change of the whole picture on a timer is exactly what that preference
 * asks us not to do. A user who explicitly picks an interval still gets it — the
 * preference sets the default, it does not overrule a deliberate choice.
