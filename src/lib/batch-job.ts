/**
 * A BATCH RENDER as a background job (plans/124 section 9, WP-F).
 *
 * The batch family - "Render folder", "Render selection", a single saved session,
 * a multi-edit download-all, "Export everything" and /pro's own Render button -
 * used to be five view-owned progress toasts around one runner. Each toast was
 * torn down by its view's `_cleanup`, so navigating away hid a run that kept
 * going, and /pro's module-level run lock was cleared only by the runner's own
 * `finally` - a remount then refused new runs with no way back.
 *
 * Both problems have the same fix: the RUN is a job. This module owns
 *   - the job that covers a whole export (row assembly, preflight, render, zip
 *     delivery), so a failure anywhere lands in `job.fail` and shows in the
 *     global toast (lib/job-toast.ts) rather than in a toast the user has left;
 *   - {@link isBatchRunActive}, now keyed to the JOB registry rather than to a
 *     boolean any one view could strand. Finish, fail or cancel - from the run,
 *     from the toast's ✕, from anywhere - and the slot is free.
 *
 * Kept deliberately light (jobs + i18n, no /pro imports) so the views can import
 * it statically and still lazy-load the batch machinery at export time.
 *
 * WHY CANCEL IS COOPERATIVE: there is no AbortController to trip. The runner
 * polls `job.cancelled` between rows (pro/run-overlay.ts), which is why the
 * handle is created with an empty cancel callback - its presence is what marks
 * the job cancellable and puts the ✕ on the toast row. Cancelling stops further
 * renders; whatever already rendered is still delivered, exactly as the run
 * overlay's own Cancel button has always behaved.
