// the hub, at an angle their (undefined) hue picked at random. Worse, the one
// axis that actually separates them — lightness — isn't positional on the disc
// at all.
//
// So they come off the disc entirely and plot on a rail beside it, ordered by
// the axis that means something for a grey: light at the top, dark at the
// bottom. The disc stays purely chromatic; the rail gives lightness the
// positional axis it never had.
