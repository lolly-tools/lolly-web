/**
 * Previous-view tracking for back pills. A view like #/start is reached from
 * many places (a tool's "Manage fonts", the Dashboard hero CTA, the profile
 * menu, the welcome dialog), so a hardcoded "← Tools" pill both mislabels
 * where back goes and dumps the user in the gallery. This module remembers the
 * ONE view the user last left — its URL and a human name — so a back pill can
 * read "← QR Code" or "← Campaign assets" and actually return there.
 *
 * The router (main.ts navigate()) is the single writer:
 *   - noteLeavingHref() stashes the exact URL being left. hashchange hands the
 *     router its oldURL; navigateTo() (nav.ts) captures location.href before
 *     its pushState. popstate has no old URL — recordLeave() then falls back
 *     to the URL snapshotted at the outgoing view's mount.
 *   - recordLeave() commits the outgoing view as "previous" — called only on a
 *     genuine view change (the router skips same-view param navigations like
 *     #/start?tab=color → ?tab=type, and forced same-route remounts).
 *   - noteMountedView() snapshots the just-mounted view — its URL and label —
 *     as the candidate for the NEXT recordLeave().
 *
 * Labels come from document.title (every routed view sets one, already
 * localised — e.g. the tool view's "{name} — Lolly", a Projects folder's
 * name), with the "· Lolly" / "— Lolly" suffix stripped; the gallery is
 * special-cased to t('Tools') since its title is the bare product name.
 *
 * sessionStorage-backed (same lifetime as the lolly:returnTo marker) so a
 * reload mid-studio keeps the pill honest; private-mode failures degrade to
 * the in-memory copy.
