 * Accessibility preferences — reduce motion / high contrast / large text.
 *
 * Same shape as the theme preference (theme.ts / lib/set-theme.ts): the profile
 * is the canonical store, localStorage is only the FOUC mirror the index.html
 * inline script reads before CSS paints, and the live switch is a data
 * attribute on <html> that all the gated CSS keys off:
 *
 *   data-a11y-motion="reduce" · data-a11y-contrast="high" · data-a11y-text="large"
 *   · data-a11y-previews="hidden"
 *
 * Strictly additive (the jelly-effects model): every attribute defaults to
 * ABSENT, no selector matches, and the regular experience is untouched. The
 * gated CSS lives beside the OS-preference blocks it extends — reduced motion
 * in parts/base.css, high contrast in tokens.css, large text in parts/a11y.css
 * — and, like those blocks, never reaches inside the tool render canvas: a
 * user's creative output must not change because the app chrome calmed down.
 *
 * hidePreviews ("Hide colourful previews") swaps the tool galleries to calm
 * icon + text cards (parts/gallery.css) and tints the Projects/session
 * thumbnails to a single primary-hued monotone (parts/folders.css) — the one
 * place imagery is kept, since a thumbnail you can't recognise is a thumbnail
 * you can't use. It was the gallery filter popover's device-local "Hide
 * previews" toggle before 2026-07-30; it lives here now because its audience is
 * the same one the other three serve.

 * used to do that and so answered with whatever was true at import — before boot
 * hydration had applied the profile, and permanently stale afterwards.
 *
 * matchMedia() is deliberately re-invoked per call rather than caching the
 * MediaQueryList. A MQL is live, so caching one looks free — but it narrows this
 * function's contract to implementations that return a live object, and the test
 * doubles across the web-shell suites hand back a fresh snapshot per call
 * (view-fade.test.ts is one), so a cache silently latches the first answer for
 * the process. Three rAF loops call this per frame; a media-query parse there
 * costs single-digit microseconds against work that is already doing FFT and
 * canvas painting, which is not worth a narrower contract.
