/**
 * session-source — a generic registry for an EXTERNAL source of saved sessions.
 *
 * The sibling of field-policy / input-policy / export-policy: a neutral seam the
 * Projects view consults to show sessions that live somewhere other than this
 * device. It is EMPTY by default, so `getSessionSource()` returns undefined and the
 * Projects view renders exactly as today — local folders and sessions only.
 *
 * It knows nothing about WHO registers a source: a deployment's optional control
 * plane registers one so a team's shared projects appear beside your local ones
 * (see src/org/), but the registry is a standalone primitive — a test or a future
 * feature can drive it the same way. A single source at a time (last registration
 * wins), mirroring the approval-opener seam; there is one "elsewhere" per shell.
 *
 * The source is a pure DATA provider: it lists projects and sessions and fetches a
 * session's full state. It does NOT open anything — the Projects view owns opening
 * (it already reconstructs tool URLs via the engine), so no engine or DOM concern
 * leaks into whoever registers the source.
