 * share-sections — a generic registry of extra sections for the Share dialog.
 *
 * A neutral seam so components/share-dialog.ts can stay unaware of any particular
 * feature. The dialog consults this registry once it has rendered its own rows and
 * mounts whatever sections are registered; the registry is EMPTY by default, so the
 * dialog is byte-identical until something registers a builder.
 *
 * It knows nothing about WHO registers a section: a deployment's optional control
 * plane registers one to offer instance-hosted links (see src/org/), but the
 * registry is a standalone primitive — a test or a future feature can drive it the
 * same way. Each builder is handed a small, product-neutral context (the tool id,
 * the already-serialised state parts, the chosen format, and a copy helper) and
 * returns a DOM node to mount, or null to render nothing.
