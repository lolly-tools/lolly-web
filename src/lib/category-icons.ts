 * Library-category glyphs — one Lucide-house icon per Catalog section, so a

 * view (views/catalog.ts) and the asset picker (views/picker.ts).
 *
 * Keys mirror LIB_GROUPS (lib/asset-category.ts) plus the sibling sections that
 * render alongside the tag-bucketed groups — 'swatches', 'fonts', 'uploads' — and
 * a couple of synonym aliases ('stock'→photos, 'type'→fonts, 'lottie'→animations)
 * so a caller using either name resolves. This is a thin category→icon-name map;
 * the path data itself lives in lib/icons.ts (the shared registry — see
 * plans/component-audit.md recommendation 5), which is where 'palette' and
 * 'filmStrip' are deduped against lib/catalog-summary.ts's near-identical
 * glyphs. Deliberately SEPARATE from that file's own map, which is a different
 * taxonomy (tool categories + asset TYPES like vector/raster) — merging would
 * force one map to carry the other's keys.
