/**
 * Shell-side MilkDrop enhancer for `[data-lolly-viz]` markers in a tool canvas.
 *
 * A tool is data, not code: it can't import butterchurn, can't hold a WebGL context
 * and can't reach the host bridge from a template script. So it renders a PLACEHOLDER
 * carrying the parameters, and this module - the same post-paint enhancer contract as
 * lottie-mount.ts and video-mount.ts - owns the canvas, the visualizer and the clock.
 *
 * THE CANVAS IS OURS, AND IT IS RE-ADOPTED, NOT REBUILT. Every paint swaps the tool's
 * innerHTML, which orphans anything inside it. Remounting butterchurn per keystroke
 * would mean a new WebGL2 context each time - browsers cap those at ~16 and drop the
 * oldest, so the tool would go black a dozen edits in with nothing logged. Instead the
 * canvas element (and its context, and the loaded preset) outlives the rebuild and is
 * appended into whatever placeholder the newest paint produced.
 *
 * AUDIO IS INJECTED, NOT LISTENED TO. The placeholder carries the decoded clip's
 * time-domain windows (host.audio's opt-in `samples`, base64) - one window per analysis
 * frame. butterchurn takes those per frame, so the image is a function of (preset,
 * palette, frame index) and not of what the speakers happen to be doing. That is what
 * makes the exported video match the audio track instead of matching the render's
 * wall-clock.
 *
 * DETERMINISM, AND WHY THERE IS A WARM-UP. MilkDrop is a feedback simulation: frame N
 * is a function of frame N-1, so there is no such thing as seeking. A single frame
 * rendered cold is a near-empty field - the black-frame failure people report as "the
 * visualizer is broken". So a jump (an export's t=0, or a scrub backwards) resets the
 * visualizer to its just-loaded state and replays WARMUP frames of real audio up to the
 * target before the frame is read; sequential playback after that costs exactly one
 * render per frame. Without the reset an export would inherit whatever the live preview
 * had built up on the feedback buffers, and the same clip would export differently
 * depending on how long it had been on screen first.
 *
 * Marker attributes on the placeholder element:
 *   data-lolly-viz    required - preset id: one of ours, or `stock:<id>` for an artist preset
 *   data-viz-colors   space-separated swatches the palette is derived from
 *   data-viz-hero     optional hero hint (the colour the palette is "about")
 *   data-viz-brand    artist-preset brand influence: off | subtle | strong | full
 *   data-viz-wave     base64 of `count × samples` time-domain bytes (128 = silence)
 *   data-viz-meta     JSON { count, samples, fps, poster }
 *   data-viz-calm     'true' → the calm treatment: the calm preset pool only, no artist
 *                     preset. The TOOL's setting, deliberately not the viewer's motion
 *                     preference - see readConfig().
 *   data-viz-fallback selector, relative to the marker's root, of the 2D canvas to hide
 *                     once this mounts
