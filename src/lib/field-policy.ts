 * field-policy — a tiny, generic per-field display-policy registry.

 * The registry is EMPTY by default, so `getFieldPolicy` returns `undefined` and
 * every consulting view renders exactly as it does today — this primitive is
 * dormant until something calls a setter.
 *
 * It intentionally knows nothing about WHERE a policy comes from: a deployment's
 * optional org-config module populates it (see src/org/), but the registry is a
 * standalone primitive with no dependency on that — a test, a future feature, or
 * a different host can drive it just the same. The human-readable `note` is
 * supplied by whoever sets the policy (already localised), so this file needs no
 * i18n and no product vocabulary.
