/**
 * vector-paint — the vocabulary shared by a canvas that PAINTS and a walker that
 * SERIALISES, so the two can agree on the same picture without importing each other.
 *
 * The mechanism it exists for: a clip bar keeps its <canvas> exactly as it is for the
 * live UI, and additionally stamps `__lollyVectorTwin` on that element — a function
 * returning SVG markup for what it just painted, or null when it cannot say. The
 * HTML→SVG walker's `tag === 'canvas'` branch asks for the twin FIRST and falls back
 * to today's `toDataURL()` on any miss, throw or timeout. A canvas with no such
 * property must serialise byte-identically to how it always has — that is the whole
 * safety guarantee for every other tool's export, so nothing here may be reachable
 * from the plain path.
 *
 * DOM-LIGHT ON PURPOSE. This module is imported by BOTH the timeline panel and
 * bridge/export.ts; the panel must never gain a static edge to the export bridge (it
 * has none today, and a twin must not be what introduces one). So the shared pieces —
 * the geometry, the markup builders, the id namespacing — live here, in a file that
 * touches only `DOMParser` and the `Element` API and imports nothing at all.
 *
 * THE DRIFT RULE. `waveformPathD` and `stillTilePx` are transcriptions of two loops in
 * views/timeline-panel.ts. If the canvas arithmetic moves and these do not, an export
 * silently stops matching the screen — the one failure this feature must not have.
 * vector-paint.test.ts pins each against the panel's expression term for term.
