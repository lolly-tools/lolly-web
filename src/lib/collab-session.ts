/**
 * collab-session — the ONE object a mounted tool needs to be in a collab
 * (plan 100 §4.6, §5; wave 1.x).
 *
 * Wave 0 and wave 1.1 each landed a piece of the machine and deliberately wired
 * none of them together: `collab-plumbing.ts` moves ops, `collab-presence.ts`
 * keeps the roster, `collab-colors.ts` derives the palette, `row-id.ts` names a
 * blocks row. Every one of them is transport-blind, DOM-free and separately
 * tested, which is exactly what makes them useless to a caller on their own —
 * `mountTool` would otherwise have to know the wiring order, the throttle rules,
 * the focus-token grammar and the colour-assignment tie-breaks, and would have to
 * know them AGAIN for the second transport.
 *
 * So this module is the composition, and nothing else. It owns no socket, no
 * `RTCPeerConnection`, no room id and no ceremony: everything that touches a
 * network arrives as a {@link CollabSessionHandle}, which is the reconciliation
 * target described below. What it does own is the four wires between the pieces:
 *
 *   1. inbound presence frames  → the presence engine's `receive()`
 *   2. the engine's outbound    → `handle.sendPresence()` (throttled by the engine)
 *   3. ops                      → `attachCollabPlumbing` against `handle.adapter`
 *   4. the roster               → collaborator colours, and one state stream the
 *                                 collab pill / focus overlay / projects badge read
 *
 * ── THE GUARD SITS ON BOTH INBOUND WIRES (§6.3, §11.21) ───────────────────────
 *
 * Wires 1 and 3 are the ONLY two doors a peer's bytes come through, and this module
 * owns both of them — so this is where `createOpGuard` runs, once per session, built
 * from the mounted tool's own declared input model. Nothing downstream is the
 * boundary: `collab-plumbing.ts` re-checks a couple of the same rules as defence in
 * depth (its `buildPatch` own-property whitelist) and the presence engine checks
 * none of them at all, because neither of them can see the manifest that says what
 * is legal.
 *
 * Three rules fall out of that placement, and each is load-bearing:
 *
 *  - **Inbound only.** Our OWN ops are not guarded on the way out. They were minted
 *    from this device's own model by `collab-plumbing.ts`; the peer that receives
 *    them runs its own guard, which is the only guard whose opinion protects the
 *    peer. Guarding outbound would cost every keystroke a schema validation to
 *    discover something we already know.
 *  - **Drop is not disconnect.** An op this build simply does not recognise — an
 *    input id a newer peer declares, a value that lost its type — is dropped, that op
 *    only, and the session carries on: PWA staleness makes version skew routine
 *    (§11.19). A STRUCTURAL breach — a prototype key, a depth/length/rate cap — has
 *    no innocent sender, and `ABUSE_REASONS` is the set that says so. It is raised as
 *    {@link CollabAbuseEvent} through `onAbuse`, and NOTHING is closed from here:
 *    disconnecting is a transport decision (it owns the peer connection, the
 *    ceremony's re-invite and the failure copy), so this module reports and the
 *    wiring layer acts. A session that hung up on its own transport would also be a
 *    session that could hang up on a Track B room it does not own.
 *  - **The whitelist is the model, read once.** Inputs are DECLARED in the manifest,
 *    never inferred from a template, so a mounted tool's set of legal ids/sub-fields
 *    cannot change while the session lives — only their values can. One
 *    `runtime.getModel()` read at construction is therefore the whole whitelist, and
 *    re-deriving it per batch would be per-op work for an answer that cannot differ.
 *
 * ── THE RECONCILIATION CONTRACT (read this before writing a transport) ─────────
 *
 * `CollabSessionHandle` is what BOTH tracks reduce to, and it is the whole of what
 * this module will ever ask a transport for:
 *
 *  - **Track A (private collab, `src/collab/`).** The ceremony (`ceremony.ts`)
 *    reaches `phase: 'connected'`, and the RTC provider (wave 2.3) builds a handle:
 *    `adapter` is the `ReferenceCanvasDoc`, `presenceIn` is the unordered
 *    `maxRetransmits: 0` data channel, `sendPresence` writes to it, `events` maps
 *    ICE state (`disconnected` → `'reconnecting'`, NEVER a leave — §11.3), `self`
 *    carries the name and palette index chosen at ceremony time (`sdp-codec.ts`
 *    carries `colorIndex` as a u8 for exactly this), `hostClientId` is the
 *    inviter's — the inviter owns the session (§6.2a), which is what lets a
 *    nameless peer render as "Host" rather than "Invitee".
 *  - **Track B (work collab, `org/collab-provider.ts`).** The registered Yjs
 *    adapter is `adapter`; `presenceIn`/`sendPresence` sit on the room's awareness
 *    lane (a handle MAY implement `sendPresence` as `adapter.presence(frame.state)`
 *    where the adapter owns awareness itself); `events` maps socket state; `self`
 *    carries the SSO display name; `role` comes from `org/collab-config.ts`'s
 *    `canEditCollab()` — a member who may join but not edit is an `'observer'`,
 *    and so is either peer after a `CANVAS_OP_VERSION` major mismatch (contract §9).
 *
 * Neither transport is imported here, and this module is never the thing that
 * decides a collab exists — `mountTool` asks for a handle and gets `null` in every
 * build that ships no provider, which is every build of this repo today.
 *
 * ── WHAT AN OBSERVER IS, MECHANICALLY ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `role: 'observer'` does not disable the plumbing — it wraps the adapter so
 * `onLocalChange`/`apply` are inert while `applyRemotePatch` still lands. An
 * observer therefore keeps converging with the room and keeps a live presence
 * entry (they are IN the session, visibly, with an observer tag in the roster);
 * their own edits simply never become ops. Detaching the plumbing instead would
 * silently stop their view updating, which is the opposite of observing.
 *
 * ── FOCUS IS THE DEFAULT PRESENCE PRIMITIVE (§4.1) ────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not a cursor: the canvas is a rendered preview, so "which control are you in"
 * is the thing that generalises to every tool. One delegated `focusin`/`focusout`
 * pair on the sidebar root resolves the focused element to the plan's focus token
 * — an input id, or `"<blocksId>:<rowId>"` for a blocks row. The row id comes from
 * the MODEL (wave 0.3's `row-id.ts`), never from the DOM: a `.block-item` carries
 * `data-block-index`, an array position, and an array position is precisely the
 * identity a concurrent insert invalidates. Delegation also means the listener
 * survives the sidebar's innerHTML rebuilds, which a per-control listener would
 * not.
 *
 * Nothing here writes a class or an attribute into tool DOM. The remote-focus
 * paint is an overlay anchored from element rects (§4.6, wave 1.2) and lives
 * outside `.tool-canvas` — this module only decides WHAT to say about focus.
 *
 * ── TIME ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This module schedules no timer of its own. Every timer in a session belongs to
 * the presence engine, whose clock/`setTimer`/`clearTimer` are forwarded straight
 * through from the options — so a test can assert that `close()` leaves ZERO
 * armed timers, which is the only honest way to prove a teardown is complete.
