/**
 * The MilkDrop visualizer's brand palette — the LOADED brand's colours reduced to
 * the handful of numbers a butterchurn preset can actually be seeded with.
 *
 * A butterchurn preset expresses colour as separate 0–1 `r`/`g`/`b` scalars (wave
 * colour, motion vectors, borders, per-shape fills), so what the visualizer needs
 * from a brand isn't "the palette" — it's an ORDERED perceptual ramp it can index
 * into, plus a few hue-distinct accents for shapes. We build both here:
 *
 *   - `ramp`   — RAMP_STEPS colours dark→light through the brand's most chromatic
 *                anchors, interpolated in OKLab (engine `rampOklab`) so the
 *                gradient a preset sweeps through stays perceptually even.
 *   - `accents`— up to ACCENT_MAX hue-distinct brand colours, for shape fills that
 *                want to read as DIFFERENT rather than as steps of one hue.
 *   - `deep`/`hero`/`tip` — the ramp's dark end, chromatic middle, and light end,
 *                named because presets reach for those three constantly.
 *
 * Colour here is SEEDING, not reproduction: a preset's own equations and blending
 * push hues around at runtime, so the goal is that the visualizer reads as
 * unmistakably this brand's, not that any frame matches a token exactly.
 *
 * Same host slice + caching shape as lib/particles.ts's chip palette (a tokenless
 * catalog falls back rather than rendering a drab visualizer), and the same
 * `tokenValueToHex` normalisation, since swatch values may be hex OR raw oklch().
