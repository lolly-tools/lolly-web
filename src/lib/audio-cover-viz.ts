/**
 * Rendering one deterministic MilkDrop frame for a cover.
 *
 * This is the bridge between lib/audio-cover-bake.ts (which owns the cache and the
 * offscreen host) and lib/butterchurn-viz.ts (which owns the GL). It is separate from
 * both so the caching logic stays unit-testable without a GPU, and so the visualizer is
 * imported lazily - butterchurn is a 44 KB chunk that a user who never opens a cover
 * picker should not pay for.
 *
 * WHY A WARM-UP RATHER THAN "RENDER ONE FRAME". MilkDrop is a feedback simulation: each
 * frame is a function of the last, so a cold first frame is a nearly empty field. Asking
 * for a single frame yields something between black and a faint smear - the exact
 * failure this area is notorious for, and it announces itself with no error at all. So
 * the visualizer is reset to a known state, driven with real injected audio for
 * BAKE_WARMUP frames, and only then read.
 *
 * WHY INJECTED AUDIO. Reading whatever the speakers happen to be playing would make a
 * cover depend on when you clicked. The frames come from host.audio's opt-in sample
 * windows instead, so (asset, preset, brand) always produces the same picture - which is
 * what makes the bake a legitimate CACHE rather than a snapshot.
