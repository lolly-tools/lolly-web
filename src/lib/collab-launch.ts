/**
 * collab-launch - a generic seam for opening a collab's invite/ceremony flow,
 * per plans/100 §0's two flavours ("Work collab" / "Private collab").
 *
 * The sibling of lib/approval-request.ts one purpose over - same last-wins
 * single-opener shape - except a collab has TWO independent openers, one per
 * track, because the two flows are structurally different (§1): a work collab
 * (org rooms, Track B) is registered from `org/` when the control plane grants
 * it; a private collab (P2P, Track A) is an OSS individual feature registered
 * from the ceremony UI, never from `org/`. Keeping them as two named slots
 * (rather than one opener the caller has to disambiguate) is what lets
 * `org/collab-share.ts` and `lib/collab-share-private.ts` each know, without
 * consulting the other, whether THEIR row has anything to open.
 *
 * STALENESS NOTE (2026-08-09): the two slots no longer share one dormant story,
 * and this header used to claim they did. NEITHER is dormant-by-default any more,
 * but they stop being dormant in different ways and for different reasons.
 *
 * The `'work'` slot is registered by `org/collab-work-opener.ts`, from `org/`'s
 * member branch, and ONLY on an instance whose control plane grants `collab.join`
 * (§7 item 9). So on a plain deployment - no control plane at all, which is every
 * public build - `getCollabOpener('work')` still returns `undefined`,
 * `openCollabLaunch('work', …)` is still a no-op returning `false`, and
 * `org/collab-share.ts`'s row still renders nothing. That is dormancy by ABSENCE
 * of an instance, not by absence of code, and it is the shape every `org/`
 * registration in this shell has.
 *
 * The `'private'` slot is NOT dormant by default any more: `collab/private-
 * opener.ts` registers it unconditionally as a side effect of being imported, and
 * `main.ts` imports it for exactly that effect (wave 2.4, plans/100 §6.1) - so on
 * every boot of this app `getCollabOpener('private')` returns a real function,
 * not `undefined`. What the flag decides is what that function DOES, not whether
 * it exists: it checks `isFlagOnSync(PRIVATE_COLLAB_FLAG)` itself and returns
 * before touching a peer connection when the flag is off, so
 * `lib/collab-share-private.ts`'s row is silent for anyone who turned it off (or
 * whose instance governs it off). Since 2026-08-10 that flag is ON by default, so
 * the shipped state is a working row - but the split is unchanged and still
 * deliberate: the flag gates BEHAVIOUR, registration happens either way (see
 * `private-opener.ts`'s own header - a flag flipped in the profile must work
 * without a reload, in both directions).

/** The small, product-neutral context an opener needs to start the ceremony
 *  for the session the Share dialog is currently open on. Mirrors
 *  lib/share-sections.ts's ShareSectionContext minus the clipboard helper,
 *  which a ceremony dialog has no use for. */

  /** The tool the session belongs to. */

  /** The export format the session implies, if any. */

  /**
   * The id of the session AS THE CONTROL PLANE HOLDS IT, when this mount came from
   * one (`org/session-source.ts`'s `TeamSessionRef.id`). Absent for every ordinary
   * local session, which is the common case and the reason it is optional.
   *
   * A work collab is a room keyed by that id (plans/100 §7), so the `'work'` opener
   * cannot start one without it - while a private collab never uses it at all, since
   * Track A pairs two devices rather than joining a server room. Hence a field on the
   * shared context rather than a second opener signature: the two tracks read the
   * parts of it they need.
   *
   * POPULATED BY ONE PATH ONLY, and never guessed. The Projects view opens a team
   * session by fetching it and rewriting the hash to `#/tool/<id>?<serialised state>`
   * (`views/projects.ts`'s `openTeamSession`) - a faithful working copy that has
   * deliberately forgotten where it came from, since the id is not an input and has no
   * business in a shareable link. So the open stashes it beside the navigation
   * (`org/team-session-origin.ts`), the tool view spends the stash at mount, and
   * `org/collab-share.ts`'s row reads it back when the user presses "Start a collab".
   * Everything else - a local session, a deep link, a reload of a team session, a
   * remount - leaves the field ABSENT, and the `'work'` opener's honest refusal
   * ("this mount is not a team session") is the answer there. The invite deep link,
   * which carries the id in the message, remains the durable path.
