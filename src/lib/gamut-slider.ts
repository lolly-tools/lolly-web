/**
 * A one-dimensional OKLCH slider whose track is BROKEN where the colour stops
 * being displayable.
 *
 * An ordinary colour slider paints a smooth ramp along its axis and quietly lies:
 * most of a chroma track at high lightness names colours no screen can show, and
 * the ramp goes flat there because every one of them maps to the same boundary
 * colour. This one samples the axis, keeps the runs that fit the gamut, and
 * and washes the rest back to a faint hint. So the track tells you where you can
 * actually go before you drag, while still reading as one continuous axis.
 *
 * On a hue track the effect is the most useful: at a fixed lightness and chroma
 * you get several solid arcs with real gaps between them — the hues that can
 * hold that much chroma, and the ones that cannot.
 *
 * Companion to the 2D charts in oklch-slice.ts: same engine primitives
 * (`inGamut`, `maxChroma`), one axis instead of two. Kept free of a CSS import so
 * it stays testable under `node --test` — see the note in oklch-slice.ts.
