 * optionally encrypts it, and PUTs it as a single snapshot to a remote the user
 * chose (sync-remote.ts). Another device sees a newer snapshot and offers to

 *
 * v1 is LAST-WRITE-WINS at snapshot granularity, stated honestly in the UI: the

 * bundle. No per-record merge yet - that's B2, and B1 exists to teach us the
 * operational truths (snapshot size, push cadence, real conflict frequency)
 * before we design it.
 *
 * The engine is PURE over injected state: it never reads a clock (the remote
 * stamps the snapshot) and never persists the sync bookkeeping itself - the caller
 * holds `SyncState` and stores it DEVICE-LOCALLY (localStorage), because per
 * plans/138 device-specific sync state is explicitly never itself synced. That
 * keeps this unit testable headless against MemoryRemote.
