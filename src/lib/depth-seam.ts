 * The tool-facing depth seam (plans/160 section 7) - `window.__lollyDepth`, and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * A tool is DATA: community/spatial-photo can never import the shell. So the web
 * shell publishes exactly one function on `window` and the tool feature-detects
 * it - absent (the CLI, both Tauri shells, any host with no model) the tool
 * renders the flat photo and stays honest.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE, separate from lib/depth-job.ts: `main.ts` calls
 * `installDepthSeam()` at module scope, so the seam is on the boot graph by
 * construction - and through lib/depth-job.ts that one edge dragged the ORT
 * canvas helpers, the depth model catalogue and the matte error classifier
 * (42.4 KB of source, ~4 KB gz) onto the render-blocking preload set for every
 * visitor, to publish a function almost nobody calls. `forImage` already returns
 * a Promise, so the driver loads on the first real request and the publish costs
 * one closure (plans/155 WP-3).
