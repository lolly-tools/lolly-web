/**
 * The cost panel's chrome strings — the minimum set (plans/65-preflight-and-cost.md §6
 * "Minimum chrome string set"), defined once as `t()` call sites so the surfaces
 * that render money import them from here rather than re-spelling them.
 *
 * ## For translators (this is a house rule, not a suggestion)
 *
 * English is the key (see i18n.ts). Two things are BUGS in a translation of any
 * string below:
 *
 *   1. A currency symbol. `$`, `€`, `£`, `¥` — none of these belong in a translated
 *      string. Every figure is formatted by `Intl.NumberFormat` from the card's own
 *      currency and interpolated as `{total}` / `{amount}` AFTER formatting. A
 *      symbol typed into a string would override the reader's currency with a wrong
 *      one.
 *   2. Splitting the figure from its source. In `'{total} using {issuer} rates dated
 *      {date}'` the amount, the issuer and the date MUST stay in one sentence.
 *      Splitting them across strings is exactly how the hedge gets lost and a
 *      count-times-a-rate starts reading like a quote. Keep them together.
 *
 * Numbers, dates and amounts are formatted first and interpolated second, so no
 * string here contains a literal figure. Mirrors the `Finding.message` house rule
 * in packages/core/src/preflight.ts.
 *
 * The disclaimer (string 4) is asserted identical to `COST_DISCLAIMER` from
 * `@lolly-tools/core` by cost-strings.test.ts, so the sentence rendered under a
 * total and the one serialised into `preflight.json` can never drift.
