/**
 * Collaborator colours, derived from the active design system (plans/100 §4.4).
 *
 * A collab paints one colour per person - the focus ring on a sidebar row, the
 * cursor and focus region on the canvas overlay, the avatar in the collab pill.
 * Andy's ruling is that those colours come from the pack that is installed, not
 * from a hardcoded rainbow: "the brand flavours the presence". This module is
 * the whole of that derivation, and it is pure - palette in, ordered colours
 * out. No DOM, no host, no module-level state, so the same input yields the same
 * colours in the web shell, in a test, and (when a Track B server ever needs to
 * label a screenshot) anywhere else.
 *
 * THE THREE CONSTRAINTS, AND WHY THEY FIGHT EACH OTHER.
 *
 *   1. LEGIBLE IN BOTH THEMES AT ONCE. A person's colour must not change when
 *      they switch to dark mode - it is their identity for the session - so one
 *      colour has to clear a contrast floor against light chrome AND dark chrome.
 *      That is what pins the OKLCH lightness: a brand's own dark navy vanishes on
 *      the dark theme and its pastel vanishes on the light one, so the brand's
 *      LIGHTNESS cannot be honoured. Hue is what survives the projection, and
 *      hue is what a viewer actually reads as "that's Priya".
 *   2. TELLABLE APART. Two collaborators whose rings differ by 15° of hue are one
 *      collaborator to anybody not staring. ΔH ≥ 50° is the plan's number.
 *   3. NOT MISTAKEN FOR A STATE. The chrome already speaks in red/amber/green - 
 *      the collab pill's own connection dot goes green when live. A ring in those
 *      hues reads as a status, not a person, so their neighbourhoods are skipped.
 *
 * WHY THIS DEPARTS FROM `lib/audio-thumb-colour.ts`'s "never invent a hue the
 * brand does not own". That rule is right where LIGHTNESS is free to carry the
 * variety - a greyscale brand gets light and dark blobs and stays itself.
 * Here lightness is spent on constraint 1 before anything else is decided, so
 * hue is the only axis left, and a one-accent pack (lolly-start ships exactly
 * one, an indigo ramp at 260°) would otherwise seat six people in six copies of
 * the same colour. Given the choice between "off-brand" and "nobody can tell who
 * is who", presence needs the second one solved. The accent still anchors every
 * spun hue, so the set reads as a family around the brand rather than a preset.
 *
 * COLOUR IS NEVER THE ONLY DIFFERENTIATOR - that is what makes the trade
 * affordable. Rings and cursors carry a 1px theme-contrast halo (the
 * selection-handle convention) and a name chip, and the roster spells everyone
 * out; §4.8 of the plan makes it an a11y requirement, not a nicety. This module
 * is one of three signals, so it may aim for "clearly a different person" rather
 * than "readable as 14px text".

 * The fixed OKLCH lightness/chroma every collaborator colour is projected into.
 *
 * Chosen by sweep, not by taste. For a candidate at lightness L, the worst |Lc|
 * over all hues rises against dark chrome and falls against light chrome, so the
 * usable range is bounded at both ends; against the enumerated surfaces (see
 * CHROME_SURFACES) the two curves cross at L ≈ 0.686 (|Lc| 41.5 both ways), and
 * the band sits a hair above it at 0.69 - light 40.9, dark 42.1, still clear of
 * the floor at every hue and worth the half point because the two themes that are
 * measured-but-not-enforced (high contrast, brand) are both dark grounds and gain
 * what the light side gives up. Chroma 0.12 is as saturated as the band stays
 * legible; hues whose 0.12 is outside sRGB are gamut-mapped down by `oklchToHex`,
 * and it is the EMITTED hex that gets measured, so the floor holds for the colour
 * that renders.
 *
 * `h` is carried only because `Oklch` has the field; hue is the free axis and is
 * always passed separately. Nothing reads this 0.

 * "headlines" - a 2px focus ring and a 12px cursor arrow are squarely icon-and-
 * border furniture, so 30 is the honest floor for the shape. 40 is that floor
 * plus ten points of margin, and it is very nearly all the band can deliver for
 * every hue against every enumerated surface at once (40.9 measured, on light
 * chrome); demanding 45 would mean either abandoning the "same colour in both
 * themes" rule or squeezing chroma until the hues stop reading as distinct
 * colours. The margin lives in the floor, not above it: 30 is where these shapes
 * genuinely stop being legible, which is why the two themes measured but not
 * enforced (HIGH_CONTRAST_SURFACES, BRAND_THEME_SURFACES) land in the 30s and are
 * documented rather than chased.

 * The chrome surfaces the floor is enforced against, per theme: EVERY surface

 * `--muted` (`--secondary` is identical to it) and `--accent`.
 *
 * `--accent` earns its place the hard way. It is the hover/active fill under a
 * sidebar row and a roster entry, which is exactly where a focus ring is read
 * most often, and it turns out to be the EXTREME at both ends: the darkest light
 * surface (#eaf0f6) and the lightest dark one (#1f2a3d) are both `--accent`, not
 * the `--muted` an eye would guess. Measured at the shipped band, worst hue on
 * the circle: |Lc| 40.9 on light (at 189°) and 42.1 on dark (at 346°).
 *
 * The whole set is listed rather than just those two, because WHICH surface is
 * the extreme is a property of the tokens and not a constant - and
 * `collab-colors.test.ts` derives all of them back out of `tokens.css` and
 * compares, so a token edit that moves a surface fails a test rather than
 * quietly shaving the margin off a cursor nobody can see. That guard is the
 * whole reason this constant is allowed to be a frozen copy.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: the tool canvas. A canvas is the user's artwork and can
 * be any colour at all - no palette can be guaranteed against it, which is
 * precisely why the plan pairs every ring and cursor with a contrast halo.
