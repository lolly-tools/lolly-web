/**
 * Shared upload dropzone - the catalogue view's "Your uploads" drop area, extracted
 * into a mountable component so the #/start Catalogue tab can offer the same ingest
 * surface. Drag files in or click to browse: a <label> over a visually-hidden file
 * input, so click-to-open is native and the input stays keyboard-focusable
 * (Enter/Space opens the OS picker; .updz:focus-within draws the ring).
 *
 * Files ingest through the SAME storeUserUpload path as the asset picker (downscale/
 * sanitise/credential-preserve/animated-sniff); a PDF/.ai converts page(s) to SVG
 * assets via the lazily-loaded pdf-import chunk, and a PowerPoint .pptx converts
 * chosen slide(s) the same way via pptx-import. An image is offered the shared
 * trim-to-content card first (plan 97 section 7.3 - see offerTrim below), which is why the
 * loop stores `await offerTrim(file)` rather than `file`. Ingest is sequential on purpose - 
 * parallel ingest of a big multi-drop would spike memory (each raster decode holds a
 * full bitmap) - and the single-flight guard is module-level so a mid-ingest re-mount
 * (the catalogue rebuilds its body per render) can't open a second lane. The other
 * half of that rule: a mid-ingest re-mount also STOPS the old loop from asking
 * anything (see `disposed`), because a question mounted into a container that is no
 * longer on the page can never be answered, and one unanswerable question would hold
 * that module-level lane shut for the rest of the session.
