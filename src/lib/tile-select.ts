/**
 * The shared multi-select GESTURES for the tile grids — Projects (#/p) and the
 * Catalogue (#/c). Both grids let you rubber-band a box through the gaps between
 * cards and Shift-click a selection dot to sweep up everything in between, and
 * both do it from this one implementation so they can never drift apart.
 *
 *   • MARQUEE — press in a gap and drag: every selectable tile the box touches is
 *     selected live. A plain drag REPLACES the selection; Shift/Cmd/Ctrl ADDS to
 *     it. A plain click on empty canvas (a press that never became a drag) clears
 *     the selection. Fine-pointer only — touch has the dots.
 *   • SHIFT-RANGE — Shift-clicking a dot selects every tile from the ANCHOR (the
 *     last dot you clicked plainly, or the last tile a marquee caught) through to
 *     that one, inclusive, ADDING them to whatever is already selected. Shift
 *     therefore only ever grows a selection — it never takes one away, so it's
 *     safe to reach for on top of a set you built up with the box.
 *
 * Each view keeps its OWN selection store — Projects a `Map<ref, kind>` (it has to
 * remember whether a ref is a folder / session / image), the Catalogue a plain
 * `Set<id>` of user uploads. Only the gestures live here. The adapter is the whole
 * contract between them: which tiles are selectable, how to read a tile's ref,
 * what's selected right now, and how to reconcile the store to a new set of refs.
 *
 * Everything order-dependent (i.e. what "in between" means) is derived from
 * `tiles()` in DOM order, re-queried per gesture — so a range always spans what
 * the user can actually see, and a grid rebuilt mid-session (a search, a filter,
 * a delete) needs no invalidation here.
 *
 * Wire it ONCE per view mount, against the persistent `viewEl` — both views wipe
 * `viewEl.innerHTML` on every render, so anything bound to the grid inside would
 * be orphaned (and re-wiring per render would reset the anchor under the user's
 * Shift-click). The delegated mousedown + the anchor both outlive a re-render.
