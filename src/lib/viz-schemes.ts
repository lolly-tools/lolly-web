 * Colour schemes for the visualizer — the brand's palette used as several distinct
 * combinations rather than one.
 *
 * SUSE ships pine, jungle and mint (close, supporting), plus persimmon, waterhole and
 * midnight (opposite, contrasting). Locking the visualizer to a single family uses a
 * fraction of that. A SCHEME picks one family as the field and one distant hue as its
 * counterpoint, so cycling schemes moves the whole picture between genuinely different
 * colour moods while every one of them stays made of the brand's own colours.
 *
 * THE RULE THAT MAKES THIS SAFE. A ramp is only ever built WITHIN one hue family; the
 * contrasting colour enters as a separate role (rim light, linework, accent) and is
 * never interpolated into the ramp. That distinction is the whole design: an early
 * version built one ramp across the entire palette, and interpolating green→blue→orange
 * produced washed-out pinks that looked nothing like SUSE. Contrast belongs BESIDE the
 * ramp, not inside it.
 *
 * Schemes are scored and filtered, not merely enumerated — "good contrast" is measured
 * (hue separation + perceptual distance + tonal range), so a brand whose colours are all
 * muddy variations of each other gets fewer schemes rather than bad ones.
