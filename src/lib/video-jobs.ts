/**
 * Streaming on-device VIDEO processing (plans/124 section 10, WP-G). ONE pipeline,
 * three ops hung off it:
 *
 *   1. MATTE (the marquee) - per-frame background removal to a TRANSPARENT
 *      animated WebP / APNG. Every RGB pixel is the source; only the alpha is
 *      model-computed, then temporally smoothed (EMA + scene-cut reset) to kill
 *      per-frame flicker. Alpha survives end-to-end: canvas.toBlob keeps the
 *      alpha channel, and engine/apng.ts / engine/webp-anim.ts splice the frames'
 *      bitstreams VERBATIM (no premultiply/flatten). The animated-image formats
 *      (WebP/PNG/GIF) can't carry audio, so those DROP it (the dialog says so); the
 *      transparent-WebM output (alpha VP9/AV1 via mediabunny, browser-gated on
 *      pickAlphaVideoCodec) keeps alpha AND the source sound AND a container C2PA in one
 *      file - see alphaVideoWriter.
 *   2. CROP - rect crop (even-dimension rounded for the encoders) to a normal
 *      video, KEEPING the source audio track.
 *   3. UPSCALE - per-frame Real-ESRGAN to a normal video, keeping audio. Desktop-
 *      first; on wasm the dialog shows an honest time estimate from a 3-frame
 *      probe and lets the user decide.
 *   4. GRADE - a colour look applied per frame: a 3D LUT (darkroom's baked .cube,
 *      or a user's own) plus film grain and a vignette. Pure maths, no model, no
 *      network; the LUT is parsed ONCE at op construction, never per frame.
 *   5. TRIM - no pixel change at all (an identity op); the WINDOW does the work.
 *      A request-level `range` narrows both the decode grid and the audio slice,
 *      so a trim is a re-encode of the selected seconds and nothing else.
 *
 * ── ARCHITECTURE: a source → op → sink loop, strictly streaming ───────────────
 * The pure loop `runFramePipeline` pulls one DecodedFrame at a time from a
 * VideoFrameReader, passes it through a FrameOp `(RGBA) → RGBA`, and hands the
 * result to a VideoFrameWriter. Memory is bounded by the reader's window, never
 * the whole clip - the wasm address space is the ceiling (the video-render
 * parallelism rule). It reports progress per frame to a WP-F job and is
 * cancellable BETWEEN frames.
 *
 * The reader/writer are SEAMS: the real ones decode with mediabunny (the
 * bridge/sequence-providers approach) and encode with the streaming WebCodecs mux
 * (bridge/video-encode-core.ts) or the alpha packers. The seams let the loop and
 * every op be unit-tested with a synthetic decoder/encoder pair - there are no
 * real codecs in jsdom.
 *
 * ── HONESTY LEDGER (same convention as lib/matter.ts / lib/upscaler.ts) ───────
 * The PURE parts below - the frame loop, the EMA/scene-cut smoother, even-crop
 * rounding, the grade op, the audio slice, the provenance branch, the estimate
 * extrapolation - are unit-tested headless (video-jobs.test.ts). The mediabunny
 * decode and the WebCodecs/alpha encode adapters have NOT been run in this
 * environment (no codecs under node); they are verified by Andy's in-browser
 * smoke test. Their shape mirrors the already-shipping sequence-providers decode and
 * sequence-render streaming mux. That covers the reader's RANGE window and its
 * source-fps derivation (mediabunny packet stats) too: the range reaches the
 * reader through a dep seam a fake can record, but what a real decoder does with
 * a windowed timestamp grid is browser-smoke-verified only. The same line runs
 * through the audio: `mediabunnyAudioRange` (decode only the window's samples)
 * is browser-smoke-only, while the DECISION around it - window first, whole-file
 * decode only when the source is short enough to survive one, otherwise drop the
 * sound with a logged warning - is unit-tested through the `decodeAudioRange` seam.
 *
 * ── PROVENANCE (plans/124 section 2 table, fixed) ────────────────────────────
 * Container-level C2PA on the OUTPUT (the existing video rule - never per-frame
 * imprints), the source video carried as an ingredient. Matte = plain
 * `c2pa.edited` ("Background removed…"); crop = plain `c2pa.cropped`; upscale =
 * the genAI-partial stamp (compositeWithTrainedAlgorithmicMedia). A catalog-
 * initiated job saves a PLAIN derived asset - the 'renders' tag is WP-B's
 * download-path contract only.

 *  - NULL AUDIO: the audio track + source exist only when `plan.audio` has samples, so a
 *    matte with no sound produces a valid video rather than crashing on an empty track.
 *
 * The whole thing lazy-inits on the first frame, when the matte's output dimensions are
