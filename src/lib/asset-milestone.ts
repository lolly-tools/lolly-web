 * Friendly, one-shot nudges as a user's device image library grows.

 * There is no cap on uploads (see bridge/assets.ts) — the library is the user's
 * to fill. But device images are exactly that: on THIS device. They're never
 * uploaded and don't travel inside share links, so an image only reaches someone
 * else once it's rendered into a file — and images everyone should always have
 * belong in the catalog. As the library crosses each milestone we surface that
 * once, informationally, so nobody is surprised later.
 *
 * Called (fire-and-forget) after every successful upload — storeUserUpload() is
 * the single choke point for every add path (picker, profile, tool, imports,
 * webcam), so one call there covers them all.
