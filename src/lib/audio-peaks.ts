/**
 * audio-peaks.ts — the MEASURED overview waveform of an audio asset, cached.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. The asset picker picks a thumbnail by type: lottie → a lottie
 * frame, video → a poster frame, everything else → `<img src=ref.url>`. For an
 * audio asset that is an `<img>` pointing at an .mp3, which cannot load, so the
 * tile renders the browser's broken-image icon. It bites hardest where the
 * catalog is mostly audio (the `lolly-start` profile is 20 audio assets out of
 * 23; SUSE has 52).
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE IS. The data half of the fix: `peaks` — `PEAK_BUCKETS`
 * amplitudes, 0..1 — for an asset, read from IndexedDB if we have measured them
 * before and derived through `host.audio.analyse` if we have not. The drawing
 * half is lib/audio-thumb.ts.
 *
 * THE HONESTY RULE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT. A waveform is a claim about a
 * sound. Nothing here ever manufactures one: there is no id hash, no synthetic
 * envelope, no "plausible" fallback shape. Every path that cannot MEASURE a
 * clip returns `null`, and the caller draws a glyph that claims nothing. A hash
 * may choose which visual FORM an asset gets; it must never choose the data.
 *
 * WHY A BYTE PER BUCKET. Peaks are already normalised 0..1 and are drawn into a
 * thumbnail a few dozen pixels tall, where 1/255 is far finer than one pixel of
 * bar height — so a `Uint8Array` is visually identical to the `Float32Array`
 * `host.audio` hands back at a quarter of the bytes (~128 vs ~512 per asset).
 * At 52 assets that is 6.6 kB of database instead of 26 kB, and it survives
 * structured-clone into IndexedDB exactly as well.
 *
 * DECODING IS THE EXPENSIVE PART, SO IT IS RATIONED. Deriving peaks means
 * decoding the whole file to PCM. Three guards keep a grid of tiles from turning
 * that into a stall or an OOM:
 *   • one in-flight derive per asset id (a 52-tile grid mounting at once shares
 *     one decode per asset, and a re-render mid-decode joins it rather than
 *     starting a second);
 *   • at most `MAX_CONCURRENT_DERIVES` decodes across all ids;
 *   • a duration ceiling, because `decodeAudioData` expands audio to Float32 PCM
 *     — a 20-minute stereo 48 kHz recording is ~460 MB of RAM to learn 128
 *     numbers, which is a tab crash on a phone.
 * A failure is remembered too: a codec this browser lacks must not be re-attempted
 * on every scroll.
 *
 * NEVER THROWS. Every entry point resolves — `null`, or nothing at all. These are
 * called from render paths; a missing waveform is a glyph, never an error.
