/* ── Authored easing ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The curve above is the one every kind was BORN with, and it stays the answer
   when nothing is authored - `recTransition` with no ease argument returns the
   numbers it always returned, byte for byte, which is the property that lets the
   compositor keep its existing output.

   What an authored ease governs is GEOMETRY ONLY: dx, dy, sc, rot. Alpha keeps
   its own fixed ramp (`pc / 0.6`, or `pc / 0.4` for the slides) because that ramp
   is not a stylistic choice - a fade that tracks a slow curve turns to mud once
   the frame has been through video compression, which is what the `aFast` comment
   below has always been about. Opacity therefore has no curve control anywhere in
   the UI, by design, not by omission.

   The wire format is a string, and it is a PERMANENT CONTRACT like the kind keys:
   either a preset name from `EASINGS` or a CSS `cubic-bezier(a,b,c,d)`. CSS's own
   spelling, so it is readable in a URL, familiar to anyone who has written a
