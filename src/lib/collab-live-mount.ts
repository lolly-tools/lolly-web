/**
 * collab-live-mount — the registrant for `lib/collab-mount.ts`: a connected session
 * becomes a MOUNTED tool, on both sides of the ceremony (plan 100 §5, §6.2a, §11.17,
 * §12 Q3; wave 2.5).
 *
 * `collab-mount.ts`'s header ends with the contract this file fulfils:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const off = registerCollabMount(mountLiveSession);
 * for (const conn of takeParked()) void mountLiveSession(conn);   // adopt the race
 * ```
 *
 * {@link installLiveCollabMount} is exactly that, and `main.ts` imports this module for
 * that one effect. Everything heavy is behind a dynamic import, so a build that never
 * starts a collab pays for this file and nothing under it.
 *
 * ── The two roles, and why they are the same code ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * The acceptor is NOT in the tool yet: they arrived on `#/join` from a link, cold. The
 * inviter IS — they started the ceremony from the Share dialog of the tool they are
 * working in. So one navigates and one re-mounts, and both then run the identical mount:
 * a one-shot session factory is armed, the route is (re)entered, and `views/tool.ts`'s
 * existing acquisition picks the handle up at mount time. Nothing else in the shell
 * learns that a collab exists.
 *
 * The inviter's re-entry is the house `'lolly:remount'` force-nav (`main.ts` listens; the
 * drop router's `routeToConsumer` is the same dance for a stash that must be consumed at
 * mount time). It is REQUIRED, not a convenience: the tool route's dedup signature is
 * `tool:<id>` with the params deliberately stripped (`routeSignature`), so changing only
 * the query never remounts on its own.
 *
 * ── The seed: why URL-mode params, and not raw input values ────────────────────
 *
 * §12 Q3 is resolved as transfer-on-connect, one path. The question this file had to
 * answer is what a "session seed" IS in the shell, and the answer is the currency the
 * whole app already round-trips state in: **URL-mode query parameters**.
 *
 *   1. It is the one serialisation that exists for every input type. `buildShareParams`
 *      (views/tool.ts) walks `runtime.getModel()` and encodes assets by id, blocks in
 *      their compact form, vectors as flat `id.field` params — and it is ALREADY handed
 *      to this feature: `CollabLaunchContext.baseParts` is its output, captured when the
 *      Share dialog (and so the ceremony) opened. That is the "serialise the current
 *      runtime model at ceremony start" step, and it needed no new code.
 *   2. It is the one that lands as `initialValues`. `views/tool.ts` parses the route's
 *      params with `parseUrlState(params, manifest)` BEFORE `createRuntime`, so the
 *      runtime is BORN with the state — hooks and the first render see it once. A patch
 *      applied after mount would render twice and run `onInit` against the wrong model.
 *   3. It is typed by the MANIFEST. A raw `Record<string, unknown>` handed across the
 *      wire would arrive as strings; `parseUrlState` coerces each param against its
 *      declared input type and drops what the tool does not declare — which is also the
 *      §6.3 rule for a peer's payload ("values then flow through the same input-model
 *      validation URL mode already applies"). The seed is untrusted input, and this is
 *      the boundary we already trust for it.
 *
 * So a seed travels as a `Record<string, unknown>` of URL params ({@link CollabSeed}),
 * is minted from `baseParts`, rides the ops hello as a query string, and is spent by
 * putting it in the route the mount navigates to. A packed `z=` query survives that
 * round trip untouched (it is one param), so a big session is not a special case.
 *
 * ── …AND WHY THE INVITER'S OWN REMOUNT MUST NOT GO THROUGH IT ──────────────────
 *
 * Everything above is about what crosses the WIRE, where a URL-mode query is the only
 * currency both devices can agree on. It is the wrong currency for the inviter's own
 * device, and reading it as though it were is how "Start a collab" silently deleted
 * people's work.
 *
 * Both halves of that route are LOSSY, by design and for good reasons. `buildShareParams`
 * skips `user/` asset ids, drops a blocks input over 8000 chars, and drops ANY value
 * whose string form runs past 150 — a link has to stay a link. `syncUrl` writes only the
 * params the user has actually edited, skips `file` inputs outright (a picked file's bytes
 * are in memory; there is no URL for them), skips provenance-less baked refs, and rebuilds
 * a fresh `URLSearchParams` that never re-adds `slot`. So an uploaded logo, a picked file,
 * a 300-character paragraph and the resumed session id are exactly the values NEITHER
 * encoder writes — and the forced remount rebuilds the runtime from the route, so before
 * this they were simply gone, with no warning and no undo (the remount resets the history
 * stack too).
 *
 * The fix is not a better encoder. It is not to encode at all: the inviter is on the SAME
 * DEVICE, so the live model can be carried across the remount BY REFERENCE. `views/tool.ts`
 * hands it over in its `_cleanup` — {@link carryMountState}, one call it makes only when
 * {@link willRemountForCollab} says a remount for this tool is armed and is this device's
 * own — and the very next mount spends it through {@link takeCarriedMountState}, on top of
 * the route's values. Nothing is serialised, so nothing is lossy: a `FileRef`, a `user/`
 * asset id and a 40 KB paragraph all survive because they are the same objects.
 *
 * Two consequences worth stating. The seed merge stays exactly as it was — it is still
 * what the ACCEPTOR is born with, and it is still the inviter's fallback if the carry ever
 * misses. And the carry is scoped as narrowly as it can be: one tool id, one shot, only
 * while a non-ephemeral plan is armed, dropped whenever the plan is.
 *
 * ── Ephemerality (§6.2a, §11.17) ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The acceptor's copy must never reach a slot on their device. The plan's ruling is one
 * interception point rather than an audit of every save: a memory-backed `host.state`
 * (`lib/ephemeral-state.ts`). This module ARMS one per ephemeral mount and hands it over
 * through {@link takeEphemeralState}; `views/tool.ts` spends it in the same place it
 * already clones the host for a manifest's `network.allowlist`, before the slot load and
 * before `createRuntime`, so the runtime, the actions bar and every save path in between
 * are looking at one object.
 *
 * ONE GAP IS KNOWN AND IS NOT CLOSED BY THAT SWAP. Filing a session into a folder
 * (`views/tool-actions.ts`) persists through `createFolderStore(host)`, which writes via
 * `host.profile.set` (`src/folders.ts`), not `host.state` — so an acceptor who FILES
 * their copy still writes a folder record to their own device. The session data itself
 * stays in memory; what leaks is a row pointing at a slot that does not exist. Closing it
 * means the same interception on `host.profile`, which is a wider blast radius (the
 * profile is identity, prefs and a11y, none of which should become ephemeral) and is
 * deliberately left for the wave that can scope it to the folder store alone.

 * Track A's acceptor waits up to `SEED_WAIT_MS` for the hello before it gets here, which
 * is ample time for the peer to hang up — the callback runs BEFORE the assignment that
 * was supposed to give it its own unsubscribe.
 *
 * That is why the order below is: register the source, subscribe, and only then decide.
 * The callback is written to work whether or not `plan.watch` exists yet (it sets a latch
 * this function reads back), and the source is registered FIRST so a synchronous close
 * disarms a COMPLETE plan instead of tearing down the previous registration and then
 * installing a fresh one for a plan that is already dead. Without both, the observed
 * result was: no pending plan, a permanently-registered session source (every later
 * single-player mount then allocates a context for an inert factory — the §11.14
