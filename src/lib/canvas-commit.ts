/**
 * Per-canvas commit channel - the 1:1 path an interactive tool uses to write a
 * value back to ITS OWN runtime.
 *
 * Interactive tool templates (mesh-gradient dot drags, street-map pan/zoom)
 * historically committed a canvas edit by reaching into the sidebar with a
 * GLOBAL `document.querySelector('[data-input-id="…"]')` + a bubbling `input`
 * event. That assumes exactly one sidebar bound to one runtime - true in the
 * single-tool view, FALSE in multi-edit (#/multi), where the FIRST match in
 * document order is the shared "fan" control bound to every sibling session, so
 * a drag on one canvas leaks the value to every similar tool. The tool has no
 * way to know which of the N canvases it came from.
 *
 * The shell instead hands each mounted canvas its own commit function keyed to
 * the runtime that owns it. A tool script resolves it from its OWN subtree:
 *
 *     var root = wrap.closest('[data-lolly-canvas]');
 *     var commit = root && root.__lollyCommit;
 *     if (commit) commit('pos1', { x: 12, y: 34 });   // 1:1 - this canvas only
 *     else …legacy sidebar poke…                      // offscreen export / old shell
 *
 * `data-lolly-canvas` is set on the STABLE canvas container (it survives the
 * innerHTML swap each paint does), so a script may also park per-instance state
 * on that element instead of on `window.__*` globals that N instances stomp.
