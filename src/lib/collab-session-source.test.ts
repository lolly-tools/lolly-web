/**
 * The acquisition seam a mounted tool asks "am I in a collab?" through
 * (plan 100 §5) - and, more importantly, what it costs to ask when nobody is
 * listening.
 *
 * This registry is the ONLY thing standing between `views/tool.ts` and a whole
 * presence stack, so its dormant behaviour is not a detail: it is the reason a
 * single-player mount is byte-identical today. The tests below pin the three
 * properties that keep it that way - dormant by default, allocation-free while
 * dormant, and unable to fail a mount when a registered transport throws - plus
 * the last-wins/unregister rules it inherits from `canvas-sync-provider.ts`.
 *
 * The module is imported FOR REAL (it has no runtime imports at all - the handle
 * type is erased), so nothing here is a source scan.
 *
 * Run directly:
 *   node --test shells/web/src/lib/collab-session-source.test.ts
