 * Intent classification for the Ask help surface (plans/103 M0).

 * Three intents decide only the ORDER an answer is assembled in, never which
 * retrieval runs — both the docs retrieve and the provider federation always
 * run (answer.ts), so a misclassified query degrades to a reordering, never to
 * a wrong or missing answer. That is the whole safety argument for a keyword
 * classifier instead of a model here.
 *
 *  - 'find'  — "where is…", "open…", "go to…": lead with in-app navigation hits.
 *  - 'make'  — "make…", "create…", "convert…": lead with tool hits.
 *  - 'docs'  — a question ("how do I…", "what is…") or anything else: lead with
 *              the extracted documentation section. This is the default, because
 *              the honest answer to an ambiguous query is the docs.
 *
 * Classification is over the shared fold/tokenize, so it is diacritic- and
 * case-insensitive exactly like the matcher.
