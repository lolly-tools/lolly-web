/**
 * Baking a MilkDrop cover to pixels — and why this one look, alone, needs baking.
 *
 * Every other cover is a RECIPE the tile redraws from cached peaks: a few bytes, crisp
 * at any size, re-skinning with the brand. A MilkDrop look cannot work that way, and the
 * reason is a hard browser limit rather than a preference: it needs a live WebGL2
 * context, and browsers cap those at roughly 16 and silently drop the oldest. A catalog
 * grid routinely shows more audio tiles than that, so "just mount it per tile" would
 * blank earlier tiles as you scroll, with no error anywhere. So a MilkDrop cover is
 * rendered ONCE, through a single offscreen context, and stored as an image.
 *
 * THE RECIPE IS STILL THE TRUTH. Pixels here are a CACHE, keyed by
 * (asset, preset, brand) — never the stored value. That is what preserves the rule the
 * whole feature rests on: the user's preset is frozen, and the brand colour re-resolves,
 * because a brand change simply changes the key and the cover re-bakes. The alternative
 * — storing the image as the cover — would freeze the paint too and strand it on
 * whichever brand was active when they clicked.
 *
 * DETERMINISM IS WHAT MAKES ONE FRAME MEANINGFUL. MilkDrop is a feedback simulation:
 * frame N is a function of frame N-1, so a single cold frame is a near-empty field, and
 * "render one frame" would produce black. The visualizer is therefore driven with
 * INJECTED audio (host.audio's opt-in sample windows) and warmed for a fixed number of
 * frames before the read, so the same asset + preset + brand always yields the same
 * cover rather than whatever the GPU happened to be showing.
