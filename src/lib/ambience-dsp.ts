 * Ambience synthesis - the background-noise beds behind the player's Atmosphere
 * section. Pure DSP: numbers in, PCM out. No Web Audio, no DOM, so it is testable
 * and could move to a worker (or the engine) unchanged. lib/atmosphere.ts owns the
 * graph that plays what this bakes.
 *
 * WHY SYNTHESISE rather than ship recordings. Generated ambience is CC0 by
 * construction (no licence to audit, and none handed on to a user who exports a
 * video), weighs nothing in the bundle, works offline on first run, and loops
 * with no audible seam by construction - the same argument that made ZzFXM right for music.
 * Rain, wind, fire, waves and the three noise colours are all filtered/enveloped
 * noise, so they land close. The harder scenes need actual structure rather than
 * shaped hiss, which is the lesson every one of them taught the hard way:
 *
 *   - Filtered noise with an envelope on it sounds like WIND, whatever you name it.
 *     Chimes and voices need formants over a glottal buzz; a street needs engine
 *     harmonics with a Doppler drop; a stream needs bubbles that chirp upward.
 *   - Struck things ring on INHARMONIC partials. A sine is a beep, not a teacup.
 *   - Events must sit in FRONT of the bed. RMS normalisation sets the level from
 *     whatever is loudest on average - so a bed mixed too hot doesn't just mask the
 *     crockery/clacks/blops, it turns the gain down on them too. `ambience-dsp.test.ts`
 *     pins the foreground-to-background ratio for exactly this reason.
 *
 * Gapless looping rests on two rules, and every generator obeys both:
 *   1. All modulation is periodic in the loop - sines with an INTEGER number of
 *      cycles per buffer, never a free-running random walk that would jump at the
 *      wrap.
 *   2. Filter state is not periodic (a filter starts cold and settles), so each
 *      generator renders an extra tail and `foldLoop` crossfades it back over the
 *      head: the last sample runs straight into the first with the settled tail,
 *      and the fade returns to the cold head where it has warmed up. Uncorrelated
 *      noise needs an equal-POWER fade or the seam dips in level.
