/**
 * nearby — the seam between the collab ceremony and a *discovery* transport: a way
 * to find another Lolly device on the same network and hand it an invite without
 * anyone scanning a QR (plans/110 §3).
 *
 * ── What this module is, and is deliberately not ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is a REGISTRY, exactly like `lib/collab-launch.ts` one purpose over. A provider
 * registers here; surfaces (the ceremony dialog, the share sheets) consult it to
 * decide whether a "Nearby" affordance can render at all. With no provider
 * registered — every plain web build — `listNearbyProviders()` is empty, nothing
 * renders, no timer runs, nothing touches the network. That dormancy is the whole
 * contract on the web side: a PWA cannot do mDNS/multicast/raw sockets, so the web
 * build registers nothing and is byte-identical to one without this file
 * (`lib/nearby-boot.ts` is the single import, and it is a no-op off Tauri).
 *
 * Two provider SOURCES are anticipated, and the registry holds one slot each so
 * they never shadow one another:
 *   - `'lan'`  — a Tauri shell's native mDNS/DNS-SD discovery (desktop `nearby.rs`,
 *                Android NsdManager). Registered by `lib/nearby-boot.ts` when it
 *                detects the Tauri runtime. This is real device discovery.
 *   - `'org'`  — a control-plane instance grouping connected members by network
 *                (lolly-work `plans/26` §8). Registered from `org/nearby-source.ts`
 *                only on an instance that grants `collab.nearby`. A SORTING HINT,
 *                never true discovery, and its `exchangeInvite` deliberately refuses
 *                (a browser cannot hand a token to a peer without a server round the
 *                two already share, which is the room, not this).
 *
 * ── The trust boundary this does NOT move ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Discovery replaces only the TRANSPORT of the invite/reply tokens. mDNS is
 * unauthenticated — anyone on a café network can advertise any name — so tapping a
 * discovered peer starts the SAME accept ceremony, and the SAS matching plates
 * remain the authentication (plans/110 §3, plan 100 §11.23). "Discoverable" never
 * means "trusted", and nothing here weakens the ceremony. The tokens exchanged are
 * the same opaque blobs a QR carries today; this module never inspects them.
