 * The boot-path half of the first-run instance choice.

 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE
 * main.ts must ask, on every boot, "is this a Tauri shell that has never
 * settled the instance question?" — two cheap probes. It used to ask by
 * importing components/instance-sheet.ts directly, which put the whole sheet
 * (mountModal chrome, the connect/probe flow, and via data-transfer.ts the
 * backup importer plus fflate) on the boot path of every shell — including the
 * web PWA, which never shows the sheet at all. Keeping the two probes and the
 * storage key here lets main.ts answer the question for ~0 bytes and
 * dynamic-import the sheet only in the rare case it is actually shown.
 *
 * instance-sheet.ts imports CHOICE_KEY/isTauriShell/hasMadeInstanceChoice from
 * here rather than redeclaring them, so the persisted key has exactly one
 * definition.
