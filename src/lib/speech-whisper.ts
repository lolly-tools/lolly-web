 * (`chunk_length_s: 30`) yields invalid timestamps on the
 * whisper-base_timestamped export (transformers.js #1358), so the caller must
 * split the clip itself, transcribe each piece inside Whisper's native 30 s
 * window, then offset and stitch the word timings. `planChunks` picks the
 * split points - at the quietest moment near each 25 s boundary, so a word is
 * never cut mid-utterance when any silence exists to cut in - and
 * `stitchChunks` does the offsetting plus the timestamp repair Whisper needs
 * (null ends, occasional non-monotonic spans).
