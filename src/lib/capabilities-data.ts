   *    itself under a dark/brand theme and falls back to the light capture when
   *    a slug has no committed dark twin (a light-only recipe). Writing
   *    `<slug>.dark` here would double the suffix into a 404.
   *  - The slug must EXIST. A missing file is a broken image in a dialog, so
   *    capabilities-data.test.ts asserts every slug resolves to a real light
   *    file, and to a dark twin unless it is a documented light-only shot.
   *  - The shot must actually DEPICT the card. Each slug here was picked by
   *    reading its recipe's alt text in docs/*.md, not by guessing from the
   *    name. A screenshot of the wrong screen is worse than no screenshot - 
   *    which is why `shot` is optional and roughly a third of the cards have
   *    none rather than a loose approximation.
