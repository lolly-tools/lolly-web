 * The collapsed/expanded preference for the Neurospicy toast dock, split out of
 * components/neuro-dock.ts so a caller can READ it without importing the dock.
 *
 * WHY: sound-toggle.ts builds its popover markup synchronously and needs to know
 * whether to offer the mobile "Show player" button. That one synchronous read was
 * the entire reason sound-toggle statically imported neuro-dock.ts — which drags
 * components/music-player.ts (~7 KB gz) onto the boot path for every visitor,
 * including the overwhelming majority who have never switched Neurospicy on
 * (lib/neurospicy.ts's DEFAULTS are `{ enabled: false }`). With the read here,
 * every remaining neuro-dock use in sound-toggle sits inside a click handler and
 * can be a dynamic import.
 *
 * This is one of the few sanctioned localStorage keys — a pure UI chrome
 * preference, never tool state (house rule: tool state goes through host.state).
 * Same key and same semantics as before the split; it must stay defined once.
