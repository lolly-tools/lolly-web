 * The one segmented-control primitive (component audit rec 1) — a `role="group"`

 * `.view-seg`/`.view-seg-btn` themselves live in styles/parts/gallery.css (an
 * always-eager sheet, so the primitive is available before any lazy view chunk),
 * this module is just the shared markup function — moved out of brand-editor.ts
 * (its original home) so views that aren't the brand studio can render the same
 * markup without importing the whole editor module.
 *
 * Every segmented control in the app should be built from this — a mutually
 * exclusive choice among a handful of named options, `aria-pressed` the ONE
 * active-state convention. Tab bars (`.dash-tabs`, `.start-tabs`,
 * `.color-mode-tabs`) are a deliberately different widget (they switch panels,
 * not just a value) and use `aria-selected` + the roving-tabindex helper in
 * lib/tabs.ts instead — see that module's doc comment for the distinction.
