/**
 * Keyboard focus containment for a modal overlay that is a `<div role="dialog">`
 * (NOT a native `<dialog>`, which the browser traps for free). Two guards, matching
 * the belt-and-braces pattern the Export popup already ships (views/tool.ts):
 *
 *   1. INERT the background — walking up from the overlay, every sibling at each
 *      ancestor level is marked `inert`, so pointer events and the accessibility
 *      tree skip everything behind the modal, wherever the overlay is mounted
 *      (document.body or a view container). Pass `inertBackground: false` to skip
 *      this guard — required for any overlay whose OWN trigger lives inside the
 *      branch that would get inerted (a body-mounted anchored dropdown, e.g. the
 *      profile/lang menus): `inert` cascades to descendants with no way for a
 *      child to opt back out, so inerting the app root would inert the trigger
 *      button too, killing its re-click-to-close affordance and, since the whole
 *      viewport is then non-hit-testable, making the page look entirely unresponsive
 *      until Escape is pressed. Reserve `inertBackground: true` (the default) for
 *      TRUE modals — the trigger that opened them is not meant to stay reachable.
 *   2. WRAP Tab/Shift+Tab within the overlay's focusables — inert alone can still
 *      let Tab graze the browser chrome between the last and first stop. Runs
 *      regardless of `inertBackground`.
 *
 * Callers keep their own Escape/close + focus-restore (most dialogs already have it);
 * pass `onEscape` only if the dialog has none. `release()` restores inert + listeners.
