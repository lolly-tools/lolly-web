 * Apply + persist a theme switch — the shared tail every theme UI runs once the

 * reimplemented ~4x: the stage HUD's cycle button, its `.view-seg` popover
 * variant, the mobile profile menu's segment group, and the profile view's
 * Appearance cards). Each copy did the same three things after picking a
 * theme id: flip the DOM/localStorage mirror (applyTheme), play the theme's
 * sting, then best-effort persist to the profile — the canonical store; a
 * failed write still leaves the theme applied (applyTheme already mirrored it
 * to localStorage). This unifies only that tail — every call site still owns
 * its own pressed/active-state repaint, since that markup differs per UI.
