/**
 * THE TWO BLUR LANES - how a composited layer gets blurred on a canvas (plan 104
 * §5.5, and the answer to §11 S1).
 *
 * The sequence compositor owns the whole blur now: `PlanItem.blur` is authored +
 * keyframe `b` + depth-of-field, plates are shot with the element's own `filter`
 * neutralised, and the executor applies the number exactly once. Which leaves one
 * question - HOW does a canvas blur?
 *
 *   • THE FILTER LANE. `ctx.filter = 'blur(Npx) drop-shadow(...)'`, one property
 *     write, the engine's own separable Gaussian. Available wherever
 *     `lib/canvas-filter-probe.ts` says it is - and ONLY there. §11 S1 measured
 *     WebKit 26.5 with no `ctx.filter` on any of the three context kinds, and with an
 *     assign-and-read-back check that reports success anyway (the value is stored as
 *     an expando). The probe is the only support truth in this codebase.
 *
 *   • THE MIP LANE. Downscale to a mip level whose residual blur is a couple of
 *     pixels, run a three-pass box blur there (three boxes approximate a Gaussian to
 *     within ~3 % - Wells' construction), and scale back up. This is the SAFARI
 *     MAINLINE, not a legacy corner: on a WebKit build it is the only lane there is,
 *     so it is built to the same bar and golden-compared against the filter lane
 *     (`tests/canvas-blur-lanes.browser.test.ts` states the measured tolerance).
 *
 * Both lanes run at IDENTITY TRANSFORM on a scratch of the plate's own resolution,
 * and the filtered result is then drawn through the executor's transform like any
 * other image. That is deliberate and it is the reason the filter lane bothers with a
 * scratch at all: `ctx.filter` inside a `ctx.scale(...)` is interpreted differently by
 * different engines (user space vs device space), which would make the two lanes
 * disagree the moment a layer had a scale transition - and would make the tolerance
 * golden meaningless. Blurring at plate resolution also matches the CSS the DOM
 * evaluator writes, where `filter` applies in the element's own box before `transform`
 * magnifies the result.
 *
 * WHAT THE MIP LANE REPRODUCES. The authored vocabulary is exactly `blur(Npx)` and
 * `drop-shadow(x y b color)` - those are the only two filter functions the tool hooks
 * ever write (`blurCss`, `shadowCss`, merged blur-first so the shadow follows the
 * blurred silhouette). Both are reproduced. Any OTHER filter function in the authored
 * remainder rides the filter lane verbatim and is DROPPED on the mip lane; that is a
 * stated limit rather than a hidden one, and it is unreachable from the shipping
 * tools.
 *
 * SIGMA, NOT RADIUS. `blur(Npx)` is a Gaussian of standard deviation N (Filter
 * Effects §blur). `drop-shadow`'s third length is a blur RADIUS and its standard
 * deviation is half of it. Getting that factor of two backwards is the classic way to
 * make a shadow twice as soft as the browser draws it, so the two are separate types
 * here and the halving happens in exactly one place.
 *
 * DOM-FREE AT IMPORT. Every global is reached behind a `typeof` guard inside a
 * function, so this module loads in a Worker, in jsdom and in bare Node - which is
 * what lets `canvas-blur.test.ts` drive the whole decision table headlessly, and what
 * lets the executor import it without giving up its DOM-free contract.

 * THE DEGENERATE BAND, and why it is not simply `[]` (plans/104 P1 obligation 5a,
 * measured in M1's browser-verify run). The Wells construction collapses to all-width-1
 * boxes - i.e. to the identity - for every sigma ≤ 0.577, and returning `[]` there means
 * the caller's residual is DROPPED. That is invisible while the residual is tiny and
 * very visible when the area rule put it there: a 3840×2160 layer asking for sigma 3
 * takes shrink 4, leaving a residual of 0.559 that landed exactly in this band, so the
 * two resamples became the whole blur and the layer was delivered at 0.72× / 0.82× the
 * asked-for softness (Chromium / WebKit).
 *
 * So the band picks the NEAREST of the two answers the quantiser can give - nothing, or
 * one width-3 box (sigma 0.8165) - and it measures nearness in SIGMA, the quantity the
 * caller asked for and the quantity an eye compares, rather than in variance.
 *
 * `carried` is what makes that comparison honest, and it is the P1 review's correction
 * (LENS 1, MEDIUM 6). The caller of this function inside a mip ladder is not starting
 * from zero: the resample round trip has ALREADY supplied
 * `MIP_RESAMPLE_SIGMA_PER_SHRINK` of blur, in quadrature, and it will be there whichever
 * answer is picked. So the two candidates are `carried` and `hypot(carried, 0.8165)`,
 * and the crossover between them sits where those two are equidistant from
 * `hypot(carried, sigma)` - at `carried = 0.5` that is a residual of ≈ 0.530, not the
 * bare `BOX_MIN_SIGMA / 2` ≈ 0.408. Comparing residuals alone made the promotion fire
 * across the whole band, including the low end where it is far WORSE than doing nothing:
 * at residual 0.41 it delivered 1.48× the request where the identity delivers 0.78×.
 * With `carried` absent (0) the crossover is `BOX_MIN_SIGMA / 2` exactly as before, so
 * a direct caller is unaffected.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It does not rescue the measured case, and the P1 review is right
 * that the first version's comment claimed it did: at residual 0.559 the two candidates
 * are 0.72× and 1.31× of the request on the MEASURED resample constant (0.541 at
 * shrink 4), i.e. |error| 0.28 → 0.31. The quantiser has no third answer there. The one
 * exact answer is to drop a mip level - at shrink 2 the same case leaves a residual of
 * 1.41, which is expressible, and delivers 1.00× - and it is NOT taken on purpose: that
 * level is where `BLUR_DIRECT_PIXELS` put the ladder in the first place, so going back
 * up costs 4× the box-pass pixels (2.07 Mpx against a 1 Mpx budget) plus ~66 MB of
 * transient Float32, per layer per frame, on the lane that IS the Safari mainline. Cost,
 * not quality, is the reason - stated here rather than implied.
 *
 * Below the crossover the answer is still `[]`, and that is honest: it IS the closest

/**
 * Which mip level to blur at, and with what residual sigma.
 *
 * `shrink` never exceeds sigma (so the resample contributes at most half the asked-for
 * softness) except under the pixel-budget rule, which is itself capped at
 * `BLUR_AREA_SHRINK_PER_SIGMA · sigma`; and never takes an axis below 2 px, because a
 * 1 px mip level has no gradient left to blur. The residual is
 * `sqrt((sigma/shrink)² − resample²)` - the asked-for variance minus the variance the
 * round trip supplies for free.
 *
 * Null means "this lane cannot express that blur", and there are two ways to get it.
 * Below `BLUR_MIN_SIGMA` nothing moves an 8-bit level anywhere. Between it and
 * `BOX_MIN_SIGMA / 2` (≈ 0.41) the ladder cannot shrink (any level would over-blur) and
 * the three-box construction's nearest expressible answer IS the identity - so the mip
 * lane applies no blur where a filter lane would apply a sub-pixel one. That is a
 * stated, bounded divergence between the lanes, not a hidden one: returning null makes
 * it cost nothing (no scratch, no copy) instead of allocating a full-size canvas to
 * change nothing. It used to run all the way to ≈ 0.87; `boxSizesForGauss` now answers
 * the band above 0.41 with one width-3 box, which is the nearer of the two answers the
 * quantiser can give, so the divergence is half as wide as it was.
 *
 * THE RESIDUAL IS NEVER STRANDED (plans/104 P1 obligation 5a). `shrink` is chosen by
 * the area rule up to `BLUR_AREA_SHRINK_PER_SIGMA · sigma`, and at that bound the
 * residual is only exactly zero when `2·sigma` happens to be a power of two - otherwise
 * a real residual is left over, and before the band fix a residual under 0.577 was
 * silently dropped and the two resamples became the whole blur. That is the measured
 * 0.72× / 0.82× under-delivery on a 3840×2160 layer at sigma 3. The fix is in the
 * quantiser, not here: this function's choice of level is unchanged, so nothing that
 * was already expressible moves.
 *
 * The quantiser is told what the resample already CARRIES (`resample`, in quadrature),
 * because the choice it makes in the band is between two DELIVERED blurs, not between
 * two residuals - see `boxSizesForGauss`. And the ladder deliberately does not climb
 * back down a level to make the residual expressible: at sigma 3 on 3840×2160 that is
 * exact (1.00×) and costs 4× the box-pass pixels against a budget this same function
 * enforces two lines up. The trade is stated in the quantiser's docblock; the level
 * chosen here is the area rule's, unchanged.
