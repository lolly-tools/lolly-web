/**
 * The three blend styles the shell offers, and the two hue routes.
 *
 * These are the *user-facing* names for an interpolation space, and they were
 * settled on the canvas gradient panel: **Smooth** (OKLab), **Vivid** (OKLCH),
 * and **sRGB** named plainly rather than editorialised — it is the classic
 * behaviour, and someone matching an existing asset wants it without being told
 * off for asking.
 *
 * They live here because two surfaces now offer the same choice — the canvas
 * gradient panel (`views/free-canvas.ts`) and Colour Lab's blend ramp
 * (`views/color-lab.ts`) — and the whole value of a short vocabulary is that it
 * means the same thing in both places. A third surface (brand gradients) is the
 * obvious next one.
 *
 * Deliberately a subset of the spaces `gradient-spec.ts` can *parse*: a hand-written
 * spec may name `lab`, `lch`, `hsl` or `srgb-linear`, and those still round-trip.
 * These three are the ones that differ usefully enough to be worth a button.
 *
 * No CSS import and no DOM, so it stays testable under `node --test`.
