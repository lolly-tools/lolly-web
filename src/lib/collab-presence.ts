 * collab-presence - the roster and the wire cadence for live presence
 * (plan 100 §4.5–§4.8, §11.4, §11.5; wave 1.1).
 *
 * TRANSPORT-BLIND BY CONSTRUCTION. This module holds who is here, what they are
 * looking at, and WHEN a frame may go out. It owns no socket, no data channel, no
 * DOM and no globals: frames arrive through `receive()` and leave through the
 * injected `send()`, so the same engine drives a WebRTC pair (Track A), a ws room
 * (Track B) and the loopback test harness (§10) without knowing which it is. The
 * clock and the timers are injected too - tests run it on fake time, and the
 * heartbeat can move into a Worker later (§11.4) by handing it a different
 * `setTimer`, not by rewriting this.
 *
 * The numbers are the plan's, pinned once here (§4.7):
 *
 *   • **50 ms send throttle** while peers are present - leading edge plus a trailing
 *     flush, so the last state of a burst always lands.
 *   • **ZERO traffic when alone.** Not "cheap when alone" - nothing sent, and no
 *     timer even scheduled (tldraw's occupancy scaling, radicalised: nothing to say,
 *     nobody to hear). Presence starts costing the moment a first peer appears, and
 *     that arrival flushes our own state so the newcomer sees us immediately.
 *   • **15 s self-refresh**, **30 s eviction**, **3 s sweep** (the Yjs constants).
 *   • **`null` state = clean leave**, applied immediately rather than waiting out
 *     the TTL.
 *
 * TWO SNAGS ARE DESIGNED IN, not left to the transport:
 *
 *  - **§11.5 - unordered frames arrive stale.** The presence lane is deliberately
 *    lossy (`maxRetransmits: 0`), so a cursor frame can overtake a newer one. Every
 *    frame carries a per-sender sequence number and the roster applies newest-only:
 *    a frame whose `seq` is not strictly greater than the one we hold for that
 *    sender is dropped, not merged. Presence is a whole-value register - there is
 *    no field-level merge to fall back on, which is exactly why the ordering has to
 *    be resolved here.
 *  - **§11.4 - a background tab is not a dead tab.** Chrome throttles background
 *    timers to ~1/min, so a helper reading their email would look evicted at TTL
 *    while the connection is perfectly healthy. So a peer flagged `away` is EXEMPT
 *    from eviction: the TTL is for silent crashes only, and a closed channel or a
 *    failed ICE connection is removed by the transport calling `remove()`. An away
 *    peer shows as away, never as gone.
 *
 * A leave DISCARDS the sender's sequence bookkeeping, so a device that reloads and
 * rejoins with its counter back at 1 is admitted straight away. The trade, stated
 * rather than hidden: a frame still in flight when the leave overtakes it re-adds
 * that peer, and the TTL is what removes it again. Ghosting for one sweep beats
 * locking a real rejoin out for 30 s. (A per-session epoch alongside `seq` would
 * settle both; it is not in the v1.1 frame shape, so it is not invented here.)
 *
 * A reload with NO leave - the tab that crashed, the phone that slept - is bounded
 * by the same 30 s: a frame whose `seq` is not newer is accepted anyway once the
 * sender has been silent for a whole TTL. Eviction alone cannot carry that, because
 * the away exemption above means an away peer is never evicted, and its stale
 * bookkeeping would otherwise stand for the life of the session.
 *
 * Ordering note for the colour engine (§4.4, wave 1.4): `roster()` returns peers in
 * FIRST-SEEN order, which is what makes "deterministic first-unused-wins by join
 * order" reproducible on every client. `firstSeen` is carried per peer so a caller
 * can re-derive it after an eviction reshuffles the map.
 *
 * No wall clock: the default clock is `performance.now()` where it exists. Presence
 * never converges (it is not the op path - §11.7), but a device whose system clock
 * jumps must not evict a peer that is sitting right there, which a monotonic clock
 * gets for free.
