 * corrupt it without a single test noticing: the 2026-08-21 glyph sweep did exactly
 * that ("invalid value type 0x1" at instantiation), and every tracker module in the
 * catalog fell silent for two weeks with green CI. Instantiating it here is the
 * guard - the file is either the Emscripten build it claims to be, or this fails.
 *
 * Run directly: node --test "shells/web/src/lib/libopenmpt-vendor.test.ts"
