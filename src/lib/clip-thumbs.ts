/**
 * Lazy filmstrips + waveforms + stills + node rasters for timeline clip bars
 * (phase 2, §4 of plans/53-fable-timeline-phase-2.md).
 *
 * A timeline shows one bar per clip and each bar wants a picture painted into a
 * <canvas>: a strip of frames (video), a peak envelope (audio), or ONE tile-able
 * still (`stillFrames` — an image box, a Lottie's mounted <svg>, or a tool clip's
 * compose render, which all reach the DOM as something an <img> can hold). Doing
 * the video case naively — one
 * <video> per bar, seeks fired in parallel — melts a browser: every element
 * holds its own decoder, and Safari/iOS silently CANCEL a seek that is issued
 * while another is in flight, so the frames you get back are a lottery.
 *
 * The contract this module enforces instead:
 *
 *   • ONE pooled probe <video>, module-level, reused across every capture run
 *     and every bar. Runs are serialised behind a single lock, so the probe is
 *     never re-`src`ed underneath a run in progress. It is removed from the DOM
 *     after an idle period (and by `releaseClipThumbs()`) so a parked editor
 *     holds no decoder.
 *   • ONE pooled decode context for peaks (OfflineAudioContext where available,
 *     plain AudioContext otherwise) — never one per call.
 *   • Seeks go through a queue that never has two in flight. Each landed frame
 *     is confirmed with requestVideoFrameCallback where it exists (its metadata
 *     `mediaTime` is the authoritative presented-frame time, unlike
 *     `video.currentTime` which is the *requested* time), with the `seeked`
 *     event as a parallel fallback and a hard per-seek timeout so a stalled
 *     decoder can never wedge the queue.
 *   • Every await point is abort-aware. Aborting settles the caller's promise
 *     promptly and, once the last caller of a shared run has aborted, tears the
 *     run down and frees anything it had produced.
 *   • ONE dom-to-image shot at a time for `nodeStill` — the photograph a bar with
 *     NO media of its own (a frame, a card, a pen shape) paints. That library keeps
 *     module-global state and clears it on every teardown, so overlapping shots
 *     corrupt each other; exports bracket themselves with `suspendNodeRasters()`
 *     for the same reason.
 *   • An LRU of ~48 decoded results, shared by every entry point. Evicted
 *     filmstrips have their ImageBitmaps `close()`d so GPU memory stays bounded.
 *
 * FAILURE POLICY: never throw into the caller. An undecodable/missing/CORS-blocked
 * asset, an aborted run, a headless (no-DOM) environment, or an oversized audio
 * file all resolve EMPTY (`[]` / a zero-length Float32Array) and the bar just
 * renders its plain fill. Callers therefore need no try/catch around an idle
 * callback.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP: returned ImageBitmaps and Float32Arrays are owned by the cache.
 * Callers must NOT `close()` or mutate them — the same instances are handed to
 * the next caller for the same key. `clearClipThumbCache()` / `releaseClipThumbs()`
 * are the only things that close them.
 *
 * AUDIO SIZE CEILING (phase-1 lesson): `decodeAudioData` expands to raw f32 PCM —
 * ~97× for opus (a 30 MB opus ≈ 2.9 GB of PCM), ~11× for mp3. There is no
 * streaming decode in the platform API, so the only defence is refusing to start.
 * Anything whose Content-Length exceeds `MAX_AUDIO_DECODE_BYTES` is refused before
 * the body is read, and a response that declares no length is read through a bounded
 * reader that abandons it at the same ceiling — the fetch is never allowed to buffer
 * an unlabelled 500 MB asset just to refuse it afterwards. 6 MiB covers a
 * ~6-minute 128 kbps mp3 with a worst case around 0.5 GB of transient PCM.
 *
 * SCHEDULING: this module never schedules itself. Callers own *when* — the panel
 * is expected to call `onIdle()` (exported here) to defer capture until the main
 * thread is free, and to abort in-flight work the moment a drag/zoom starts.
 *
 * SCRUB PROXIES (phase 4 Track A): both entry points read through
 * `peekScrubUrl()` (lib/clip-proxy.ts), so an uploaded clip that has a
 * keyframe-dense 720p proxy is decoded from the proxy instead of the original —
 * a filmstrip is 24 random seeks, which is precisely the workload a long GOP
 * punishes. The lookup is SYNCHRONOUS and falls back to the original URL, so a
 * missing/unbuilt proxy costs one map miss; `primeScrubUrl()` is kicked off (not
 * awaited) on the miss so the next call can use it. The cache key follows
 * whichever URL was chosen, so proxy and original results never collide.
 * This is a PREVIEW-ONLY substitution — nothing here is on an export path.

// The gap this closes: `stillFrames` needs something an <img> can hold, and a text
// card, a pen shape, a coloured frame or a composed group has nothing of the sort.
// Those bars fell back to one flat fillRect of the box's own background — and a
// TRANSPARENT one (a plain text box, and every `kind:'path'` box, whose fill the tool
// hook forces to transparent) painted literally nothing. A timeline of frames was
// therefore a row of near-identical rectangles, or of blanks.
//
// So photograph the box. That is a dom-to-image shot, an order of magnitude dearer
// than every other producer in this module, and it is fenced on four sides:
//
//   • the CALLER declines cheap: `MAX_NODE_RASTER_NODES` subtree elements, and only
//     boxes that would actually show something (see canRasterBox in timeline-panel);
//   • the caller also enforces a per-PASS budget, so twenty frames cannot queue
//     twenty shots in one idle callback;
//   • at most ONE shot is in flight process-wide (see `nodeLock`) — dom-to-image-more
//     keeps MODULE-GLOBAL mutable state (its options, its url cache, its sandbox
//     iframe) and the teardown at the end of ANY call clears it, including out from
//     under a call still running. The lock is held until the library call REALLY
//     settles, not until the caller stops waiting for it (see below);
//   • every shot is time-boxed by `NODE_RASTER_TIMEOUT_MS`. The library call itself is
//     uncancellable, so the race is the containment: a late result is abandoned by the
//     CALLER while the LOCK stays held — releasing it on the timeout would let the next
//     shot run concurrently with the one that timed out, which is exactly the overlap
//     the lock exists to prevent;
//   • a shot that produced nothing is REMEMBERED (`nodeFailed`), so a box that cannot
//     be photographed — tainted image, pathological cost, a timeout — costs one attempt
//     rather than one attempt per pass forever, starving every bar behind it.
//
// And because those globals are shared with the EXPORT path, `suspendNodeRasters()`
// brackets any export that rasterises: a thumbnail shot overlapping an export would
// corrupt both pictures. Suspending only stops NEW shots, so an export must also
// `await drainNodeRasters()` — a shot already inside the library cannot be cancelled,
// only waited out.
//
// The result is ONE bitmap, tiled by the bar exactly like a still. A node-mode box
// cannot animate by construction — the moment it contains a <video>, an <img>, a
// Lottie marker or an audio marker the caller classifies it as media and takes one of
// the branches above — so N distinct rasters would cost N times as much to produce N
// identical pictures.

 *     later and the user may have scrubbed onto this box meanwhile — and then the park is
 *     the damage, not the class: the applier removed `.seq-off`, believed the scene live,
