/**
 * The artist MilkDrop presets — community work, run as authored, with the brand's colours
 * pushed through them.
 *
 * WHY THESE EXIST ALONGSIDE OURS. The community presets (Geiss, Flexi, Rovastar, Aderrasi,
 * martin and ~110 others) are twenty years of accumulated craft: camera moves, overlay
 * elements and layered effects well beyond what our hand-authored set reaches. Ours stay
 * for guaranteed brand fidelity and a licence-clean default; these are the range.
 *
 * PROVENANCE. Never committed to this repo. `scripts/copy-viz-presets.ts` stages a curated
 * selection out of the `butterchurn-presets` dependency at build time into a gitignored
 * public directory, and `scripts/viz-preset-list.json` holds identifiers only. So the
 * dependency declares provenance rather than our source tree absorbing it. A clone without
 * the dependency installed simply gets an empty artist list and the brand-native presets.
 *
 * BRAND INFLUENCE — the technique that makes this work. These presets compute their colour
 * inside their own composite shaders, so `baseVals` overrides are ignored and any
 * after-the-fact tint just flattens them. Instead we WRAP the shader: our brand header goes
 * before theirs, their body runs untouched, and a blend toward the brand ramp is appended
 * as the last statement. Verified across the whole pack — every one of the 1122 composite
 * shaders assigns `ret` in its body, so there is always something to blend.
 *
 *   [our header: BRAND_* consts, brandRamp, brandTone, lolLum]
 *   [their header, verbatim]
 *   shader_body { [their body, verbatim] ret = <brand blend>; }
 *
 * The blend keeps their luminance structure — which is where the motion and the modelling
 * live — and drives hue and saturation from the brand. Deliberately allowed to push past
 * "tasteful": Andy's brief is that the brand should INFLUENCE these, not merely tint them,
 * and over- or under-saturation is fine in service of that.
 *
 * COST TO KNOW: these carry their equations as source strings, so butterchurn compiles them
 * with `new Function`. That reintroduces the `unsafe-eval` dependency our own presets avoid
 * (see lib/viz-presets.ts). Nothing breaks today — the shell sets no CSP — but a future
 * `script-src` would have to exempt the visualizer or drop this list.
