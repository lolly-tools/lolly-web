 * Ambience bake worker. Synthesising a bed is a few million samples of filtered

 * for the café murmur (five modulated voice bands). On the main thread that is a
 * visible freeze at the exact moment someone clicks a layer on, so it runs here.
 * Pure compute: lib/ambience-dsp.ts is DOM-free, so it runs unchanged in worker
 * scope, and the channels come back as transferables (no copy).
