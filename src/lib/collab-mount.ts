/**
 * collab-mount — the single seam between a ceremony that has just CONNECTED and the
 * code that turns that connection into a live co-editing session (plan 100 §5, §6.2a,
 * §11.17; wave 2.5's door, opened here in 2.4).
 *
 * The house single-provider pattern, fourth of its kind: `lib/canvas-sync-provider.ts`
 * registers the convergence adapter, `lib/collab-session-source.ts` registers the
 * per-mount session factory, `lib/collab-launch.ts` registers the two openers — and this
 * one registers the MOUNT. Same rules throughout: one registrant at a time, last wins,
 * dormant by default, a throwing registrant swallowed so a ceremony can never be broken
 * by the thing it hands off to.
 *
 * WHERE IT SITS IN THE CHAIN, because four registries is three too many to hold in your
 * head: the ceremony ends with a live pair and nowhere to put it; `collab-session-source`
 * is asked, per tool mount, whether THIS tool on THIS slot is in a collab. Nothing joins
 * those two facts. That join is the registrant here — given a {@link CollabConnection} it
 * builds a `CollabSessionHandle` over the transport, registers it as the session source
 * for the slot the ceremony ran from (§6.2a pins a private collab to exactly that slot),
 * gives the acceptor a memory-backed `host.state` so its copy stays ephemeral (§11.17),
 * and takes the user to the tool. None of that belongs in a dialog, and none of it can be
 * written until the session composition exists — hence a seam rather than a call.
 *
 * WHY A PARKING SURFACE EXISTS, and why it is not over-engineering. The ceremony is
 * driven by two humans on their own schedule; the mount is registered by whichever
 * module owns co-editing, and in a lazily-chunked shell that module may not be loaded
 * yet — the acceptor arrives on `#/join` cold, from a link, with no tool view ever
 * having mounted. So the two events genuinely race. Dropping a connection because the
 * adopter was half a second late would throw away a completed WebRTC pairing that costs
 * two people a fresh ceremony to rebuild (§6.1: a dropped connection needs a whole new
 * invite). {@link parkHandle} keeps it; {@link takeParked} is how the stitch adopts it.
 *
 * The stitch's contract, stated once so it is not folklore:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const off = registerCollabMount(mountLiveSession);
 * for (const conn of takeParked()) void mountLiveSession(conn);   // adopt the race
 * ```
 *
 * Registration deliberately does NOT drain by itself. The registrant decides when it is
 * ready to receive (it may want its own state wired first), and a drain hidden inside
 * `registerCollabMount` would fire re-entrantly during the registrant's own import.
 *
 * WHAT PARKING CANNOT DO, said plainly. A parked connection is a live transport — in
 * Track A an `RTCPeerConnection` with three data channels attached. The ceremony dialog
 * will not close it: `CeremonyConnectedHandle.close()` closes the DIALOG, and the
 * transport was handed to whoever built it (see `components/collab-ceremony.ts`'s
 * `releaseEffects` — after `onConnected` the dialog will not hang up). That is why
 * {@link CollabConnection} carries its own {@link CollabConnection.close}: the adopter
 * needs it, AND it is the only thing that can hang the pair up. It is also why
 * {@link MAX_PARKED} is small — an unadopted connection is a leak we can bound, so the
 * oldest is evicted (and closed, since we hold the only handle to it) rather than
 * accumulating.
 *
 * WHY THIS SEAM IS TRANSPORT-AGNOSTIC (wave 2.5). It carried an `RtcTransport` while
 * Track A was the only producer. It no longer does: the connection arrives as a built
 * {@link CollabSessionHandle} — the one thing `createCollabSession` asks a transport for
 * — plus a `close()` that hangs up whatever is underneath. Track A wraps its transport
 * inside that `close()` (`collab/rtc-connection.ts`); Track B wraps `provider.close`
 * (`org/collab-handle.ts`). One mount serves both, and neither track's object shape
 * leaks into the seam or into the mount registered on it (§7's last paragraph: the shell
 * has exactly ONE collab client implementation — only the transport object differs).
 *
 * SO PARKING IS BOUNDED THREE WAYS, and the third one is the one that matters. Eviction
 * at {@link MAX_PARKED} closes what it drops; {@link takeParked} hands ownership to the
 * adopter; and {@link releaseParked} is what the CEREMONY calls when its dialog closes
 * with nobody having adopted the pair. Without that last one the whole flow ends in a
 * lie: `collab/join-route.ts`'s `onClose` paints "This collab is closed. Nothing else is
 * being shared." while the peer connection and its three channels are still open for the
 * lifetime of the page — and today, with no mount registered anywhere in product code,
 * that is EVERY successful private collab, not an edge case. A parked connection whose
 * ceremony is gone has no adopter coming: the ceremony is how a connection gets here.
 *
 * There is deliberately no TTL on top of those three. A timer cannot tell "the stitch is
 * half a second late" (the race parking exists for) from "nobody is coming", so it would
 * either be long enough to be no bound at all or short enough to hang up a pair the
 * adopter was about to take. The dialog closing is the fact, not a guess about one.
