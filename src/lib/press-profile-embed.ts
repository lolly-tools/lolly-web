/**
 * The user's own CMYK profile, resolved into the bytes a PDF/X-4 output intent
 * embeds — and into the identity that intent may honestly declare.
 *
 * ## Why this module exists
 *
 * PDF/X-4 requires the destination profile to be EMBEDDED. No CMYK ICC ships in
 * this repo, so for years a Print PDF's intent was a registry NAME — a true and
 * useful statement of the press condition, but not X-4. `lib/color-profiles.ts`
 * changed the ingredients: a profile the user loaded is on the device, content
 * addressed, and parseable. This is the join between that library and the export
 * path, and it is the ONLY route by which a `/DestOutputProfile` reaches a CMYK
 * intent.
 *
 * ## The identity trap, and how it is made impossible
 *
 * The tempting shortcut is to embed a loaded profile under whichever condition the
 * export panel happens to name — "you picked FOGRA39, here are your FOGRA39-ish
 * bytes". That produces the confidently-wrong file. Our own source list has the
 * counter-example: `SWOP2006_Coated3v2.icc` has "SWOP" in its `desc`, so a
 * desc-match pairs it with the `swop` condition, whose intent identifier is
 * `CGATS TR 001` — while that file is built from TR003. Different numbers, same
 * word.
 *
 * So identity is DERIVED from the profile, never from the picker:
 *  - the four registry rows (`fogra39` …) keep their exact previous meaning —
 *    name only, no embedded profile, no behaviour change;
 *  - choosing an `own:<digest>` row embeds THAT profile, and the OutputIntent's
 *    identity is read off it. Paired (below) → the registry name; unpaired →
 *    `Custom` with the profile's own description and no RegistryName.
 *
 * A file that says FOGRA39 while carrying FOGRA51 bytes therefore cannot be
 * produced: the user never selects those two things independently.
 *
 * ## What counts as pairing evidence
 *
 * 1. **Provenance.** A profile Lolly itself fetched from the ICC registry for
 *    condition X is paired to X by construction (`meta.origin`, recorded at
 *    ingest). Note the registry's SWOP profile states `CGATS TR003`, so
 *    `sourceIsExact()` is false for it and it pairs to NOTHING — the Custom
 *    branch. That is the right answer, not a gap. Provenance is testimony about
 *    where bytes came from, so it does not outrank the bytes: when the file's own
 *    `targ` names a DIFFERENT known condition, the two contradict each other and
 *    neither is declared (`Custom`). Only a contradiction demotes — a profile whose
 *    `targ` names nothing we recognise (`Coated_Fogra39L…` is built on FOGRA39L
 *    data and spells it its own way) keeps its provenance pairing.
 * 2. **`targ`.** The profile's own `FILE_DESCRIPTOR` (`iccCharacterization`)
 *    equal, after normalisation, to the condition's characterization name.
 *    Testimony from inside the file — present on ECI/Fogra-lineage profiles a
 *    print shop already has.
 * 3. Numeric agreement against published aim values would be real evidence. No
 *    aim data ships, so it is UNAVAILABLE and not approximated.
 * 4. A `desc` substring is NOT evidence. `matchesCondition` stays what it is: a
 *    UI affordance for labelling a row.
 *
 * Tier 1 or 2 pairs; anything else is `Custom`. Not a refusal — the user still
 * gets an embedded, conformant X-4 file. It just declares the profile's own name
 * instead of a registry name nothing on this device can substantiate.
 *
 * DOM-free, so it tests under plain `node --test` with a fake host.
