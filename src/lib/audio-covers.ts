/**
 * Per-user cover art for an audio asset - the OPT-IN override over the generated look.
 *
 * THE GENERATED DEFAULT IS THE PRODUCT. Every audio asset already gets a waveform shape
 * and a brand colour derived from its id, free, with no interaction (lib/audio-thumb.ts
 * + lib/audio-thumb-colour.ts). This module exists only so the handful of tracks a user
 * actually cares about can be styled deliberately. There is no empty state, no prompt
 * and no nag: someone who never opens the details modal must never notice a feature is
 * missing, and the honest measure of success here is how RARELY this is used. If people
 * feel they have to customise, the generated default is not good enough and the fix
 * belongs upstream, not in a bigger picker.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS STORED IS A RECIPE, NOT PIXELS ─────────────────────────────────────
 * `"<shape>"`, `"<shape>:<colourIndex>"`, `"viz:<presetId>"` or `"viz:<presetId>:<i>"` - 
 * a few bytes on the profile. That split is the whole design:
 *
 *   STRUCTURE IS FROZEN. The shape is what the user chose and nothing we do may change
 *   it. A rebrand must never turn their blob into a ring.
 *
 *   COLOUR RE-RESOLVES. The index points into the ACTIVE brand's pool rather than at a
 *   hex, so a cover re-skins when the brand changes and keeps mixing with its
 *   environment. That is desired behaviour, not drift - the user picked a generative
 *   default, so seeing it follow the brand is the point.
 *
 * Storing a hex would freeze the paint as well and strand the cover on whichever brand
 * happened to be active; storing an image would additionally cost real bytes and stop
 * it re-rendering crisply at any size. A MilkDrop cover follows the SAME rule: the
 * preset id is the truth and any rendered pixels are a cache that can be thrown away and
 * regenerated - which is what lets a MilkDrop cover re-skin on a rebrand too, since the
 * brand colour is baked into the shader wrapping rather than into the stored value.
 *
 * ── WHY THE PROFILE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A catalog asset is a PERMANENT CONTRACT and cannot be mutated, so an override has to
 * be a per-user overlay keyed by asset id. That is exactly what favourites, hides and
 * category overrides already are, so this follows lib/asset-favourites.ts rather than
 * inventing a second mechanism - same base-id keying, same load/save shape, and it
 * travels in the portable profile backup so a cover is not stranded on one device.
