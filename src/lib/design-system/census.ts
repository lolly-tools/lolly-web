 * `DesignCensus` - the one shape every design-system source scans into.
 *
 * Plan 97 §8: a Source scans material into a census, the census feeds the role
 * proposer, and everything lands as candidates in the tray. Until now
 * `proposeBrandRoles` only spoke Penpot's `PenpotUsage`, so a guidelines PDF, a
 * screenshot or a logo SVG had no route to the same proposal at all. This module
 * is the keystone: a small pure type, one adapter per source, and
 * `censusToUsage` - the bridge that lets the shipped `brand-propose.ts` pipeline
 * run over any source unchanged.
 *
 * Adapting TO the existing shape rather than retargeting the proposer is
 * deliberate. `brand-propose.ts` is shipped, covered and high-traffic, and its
 * four paint buckets (fills / strokes / text runs / gradient stops) are exactly
 * the distinctions the proposal scores: surface comes from fills, text from text
 * runs, and a colour sharing a gradient with the surface leaves the accent pool.
 * A census that could not express those four would lose the proposal's judgement,
 * so `CensusColor.kind` carries them and nothing else.
 *
 * Weights are occurrence counts, never normalised: the proposer only ever
 * compares them, and rescaling one source's counts against another's would be a
 * claim about relative importance that no source actually makes.
 *
 * Pure and DOM-free on purpose - unit-testable under plain node, importable from
 * any shell module.

 *    gradients only, so the shade exclusion works; a source that wants its stops
 *    tallied says so with `kind: 'gradient'` colours (which is what the Penpot
 *    adapter does). Synthesising them here would push colours into the accent
 *    pool that no source ever claimed were painted.
 *  - **Stops are spaced evenly.** A census records which colours a gradient runs
 *    through, not where they sit; the proposer reads stop colours only.
