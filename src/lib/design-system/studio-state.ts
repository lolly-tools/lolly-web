 * One head document, one write path. Every committed action installs the whole
 * tokens document immediately through `installUserTokens` - the single write
 * chokepoint (plan 97 §3 principle 9) - and what makes immediate safe is the
 * session undo stack kept here plus the rolling checkpoints persisted in
 * `host.state`. There is no draft/committed split to leak.
 *
 * DOM-free on purpose, so it runs under plain node in tests: installing busts
 * the tokens caches but nothing repaints the chrome by itself, so the view
 * passes its `applyChromeBrandVars` call as the `afterInstall` option rather
 * than this module reaching for the document.
 *
 * Documents crossing this boundary are always cloned: `doc()` hands back a copy
 * so a caller mutating it (the brand-doc helpers all mutate in place) cannot
 * move the head behind our back, which is what keeps an undo snapshot an honest
 * picture of the state before the action.
