/**
 * type-compare.ts - the Type room's side-by-side compare stage (plan 97 section 7.2, M4).
 *
 * Nothing in this shell has ever let anyone SEE two faces before choosing one.
 * The brand editor's type panel is commit-then-look: a Google family installs
 * first and shows itself afterwards, and an uploaded file is only visible once
 * it is a stored asset. This stage is the answer - candidates from all three
 * sources stand next to each other on ONE editable specimen, at ONE size, and
 * nothing is installed until a card is chosen.
 *
 * PRESENTATION ONLY, ON PURPOSE. This module never writes a token, never stores
 * an asset and does not import user-fonts.ts. A press hands a `CompareChoice` to
 * `ctx.onSelect` and the caller persists it - `installGoogleFont` for a Google
 * family, `installFontFromBytes` for a file. That split is what keeps the stage
 * testable under jsdom, and it is the same seam the tray uses (a surface asks;
 * the room that owns the material commits).
 *
 * NETWORK. Google Fonts is the one egress in this whole studio, and it is
 * already consent-gated in the type panel. Every fetch here rides the SAME gate:
 * `ctx.consentGoogle()` must resolve true before a single request is made, and a
 * decline leaves the card saying so plainly rather than quietly falling back.
 * Once consent is given it holds for the mount, so the second Google candidate
 * previews without asking again. Nothing else in this file touches the network.
 *
 * PREVIEW FACES NEVER PERSIST. A previewed face is an in-memory `FontFace` added
 * to `document.fonts` under a session-scoped family name (`__ds-preview-<slug>-<n>`
 * - see `previewFamilyName`), and it is `delete`d when its card is removed or the
 * stage is torn down. It is not an asset, it is not in IndexedDB, and it does not
 * survive a reload. The serial in the name is not decoration: two cards can hold
 * the same family from different sources (a Google Inter beside an uploaded
 * Inter.ttf) and must never share one registration, or removing either would
 * blank the other.
 *
 * NO FACE PRETENDS TO BE ANOTHER. A card whose face has not loaded - not fetched
 * yet, declined, failed, or a browser with no FontFace at all - renders its
 * specimen in the INTERFACE face and says that is what you are looking at. A
 * silent fallback here would be the one unforgivable bug in a type comparison:
 * you would choose a face you never saw. For the same reason "Use this face" is
 * disabled until the card is `ready`.
 *
 * A PRESS ALWAYS ANSWERS. The card row is rebuilt wholesale on every state
 * change, so a load that ends changes nothing but text in a subtree that was
 * just replaced - invisible to anyone not watching it. Two rules follow. Every
 * finished load is `announce`d once (ready, failed, declined), and the card
 * itself is focusable (`tabindex="-1"`, named by its family, described by its
 * state sentence) so the repaint has somewhere to put the keyboard that is NOT
 * the Remove button - pressing Preview must never leave the next Enter on
 * Delete. When the repaint does land on the card, the announcement is skipped:
 * the description says the same thing, and hearing it twice is worse than once.
 *
 * TWO HALVES, like trim-offer.ts.
 *   PURE - the candidate model (`admitCandidate`, the cap), the preview-family
 *   naming, the load state machine (`applyCardEvent`), the Google face pick
 *   (`pickPreviewFace`), the honesty facts read off a font file
 *   (`describeFaceBytes`), the default specimen text, and the markup
 *   (`compareCardsHtml`). All unit-tested in type-compare.test.ts.
 *   BROWSER - `mountTypeCompare`: the DOM, the FontFace registrations, the
 *   consent-gated fetch, the drop zone.
 *
 * COPY. Strings arrive as `ctx.t` / `ctx.tRaw` (the consuming file's i18n
 * bindings) so the stage can be mounted from any surface without reaching for
 * the runtime - trim-offer.ts's precedent.
