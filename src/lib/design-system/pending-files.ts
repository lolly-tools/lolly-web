/**
 * The mark handoff stash (plan 97 section 8, M5) - how logos extracted somewhere else
 * (the `#/pdf` exploder's "Send to the Design System studio") reach the Logos
 * room across one navigation.
 *
 * This is the `takePendingToolFile` pattern from `lib/drop-router.ts`, kept to
 * the letter: a module-level one-shot stash, cleared on read, that survives
 * exactly one navigation and never touches disk. Nothing here persists, so a
 * reload loses the handoff - which is the honest behaviour: the marks were
 * extracted from a file the studio no longer holds, and a stale queue of
 * mystery chips a week later would be worse than an empty room.
 *
 * The sender stashes; the Logos room drains ONCE per mount and queues what it
 * finds as ordinary confirm chips. It is deliberately not an install path - a
 * mark that arrives from a PDF is classified and confirmed exactly like a mark
 * the user dropped by hand, so nothing lands in a slot without a tap.
 *
 * The caps mirror the room's own: {@link PENDING_LOGO_MAX_FILES} marks, each at
 * most {@link PENDING_LOGO_MAX_BYTES} (the limit `installLogo` enforces anyway).
 * Over-cap files are dropped here, at the send, rather than travelling to a room
 * that would only refuse them - and the drop is REPORTED BACK (as well as
 * warned), because the caller is the one that promised a count and is the only
 * one that can correct it. A send that arms nothing must not read as a success.
