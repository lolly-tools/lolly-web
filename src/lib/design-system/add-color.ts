 * "Add a colour" - the Colours room's level-0 control (plan 97 section 7.1).
 *
 * Two halves, deliberately separable:
 *
 *  - `parseColorEntries` is pure and DOM-free: it reads EVERY colour it can find
 *    in arbitrary pasted text - a hex list, a CSS blob, a paragraph out of a
 *    style guide - and hands back the notation as typed alongside a resolved
 *    `#rrggbb`. The scan is deliberately in the spirit of `engine/svg-colors.ts`:
 *    regex over raw text, no parser, never throws, every candidate gated before
 *    it is trusted. Hostile input is expected - this reads the clipboard.
 *  - `mountAddColor` renders one input row over it. Nothing it parses reaches
 *    the design system on its own: a single colour needs Enter or Add, several
 *    need an explicit "Add all" / "Add selected". Principle 1 - additive, never
 *    imposed. The caller decides what an add MEANS (`addSwatch`, a tray drop);
 *    this control only ever reports entries.
 *
 * The module takes `t` as an argument rather than importing i18n, so the pure
 * half stays importable from a test with no shell boot behind it.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT MERGED: dedupe keys on the resolved colour INCLUDING alpha, so a
 * translucent value and its opaque twin both survive as separate entries (they
 * are separate swatches; a palette that silently ate one would be lying). Their
 * `hex` field is the same opaque `#rrggbb` - it is the resolved colour, not an
 * identity.

 *     (no parens, quotes, semicolons, braces, angle brackets or backslashes) and
 *     is length-BOUNDED: an unterminated `oklch(` at every position would
 *     otherwise scan to end-of-text each time, which is the quadratic case.
 *  3. A `#hex`, with a lookahead that refuses a run of hex-ish characters longer
 *     than 8 rather than reading a prefix out of it (`#ff0000abc` is garbage,
 *     not `#ff0000ab`).
