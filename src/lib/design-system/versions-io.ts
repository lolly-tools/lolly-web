/**
 * versions-io.ts - publishing, activating and restoring design-system versions
 * (plans/97 section 6a). The Versions panel's whole vocabulary, with no DOM in it.
 *
 * The rules this module exists to hold in one place:
 *   - **The bytes go through the chokepoint.** Nothing here writes an asset
 *     itself: a version payload goes to `installUserTokens` with an explicit
 *     `versionSlug`, which is where immutability is enforced, and the head
 *     document goes through the caller's `install` (the studio's undo stack) or
 *     the same chokepoint by default.
 *   - **Order matters.** The version ASSET is written before the ledger entry.
 *     Interrupted the other way round, the ledger would name a version nothing
 *     can load; interrupted this way it leaves an orphan asset, which the next
 *     publish of that name is free to reclaim (bridge/tokens.ts says so too).
 *   - **A version stores no ledger.** The list belongs to the head; a copy of it
 *     inside a version would be a second, instantly-stale source of truth.
 *   - **Publishing copies no bytes.** The asset manifest records `{id, version,
 *     sha256}`; the copy-on-write hook in bridge/version-assets.ts preserves the
 *     bytes if and when something would destroy them.
 *
 * Scope: WRITES are always the user's own design system (`user/tokens/brand` and
 * its siblings) - the thing the studio edits and publishes; this module never
 * writes a pack's namespace. READS are relative to whatever head the bridge
 * discovered, because a device whose system came from a pack has a
 * `<ns>/tokens/brand` head with its versions beside it, and reading those under
 * the user id would report every one of them as missing.
 *
 * DOM-free like studio-state.ts, so it runs under plain node in tests.
 */
