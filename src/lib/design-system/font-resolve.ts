 * font-resolve.ts - the pure family-name resolver of plan 97 §7.2 (gap 3).
 *
 * A face discovered inside a PDF or on a website arrives as one string and
 * nothing else: "ABCDEF+Inter-SemiBold", "HelveticaNeue-Bold",
 * "RobotoCondensed-LightItalic". Until that string is split into a family, a
 * weight and a slant it is a dead end - it cannot be compared on the specimen
 * stage, cannot be matched against Google Fonts, and cannot be assigned a role.
 * This module does the splitting, and only the splitting: no DOM, no network,
 * no state. The Type room decides what to DO with the result.
 *
 * Three honesty rules run through it:
 *
 *  1. **A guess is labelled a guess.** The weight and slant come from words in
 *     a name, not from the font program. `parseFaceName` reads what the name
 *     SAYS. Where the bytes are in hand the file always wins, and the one
 *     reading of the file that lives here is `variableWeightRange` - the `fvar`
 *     axis a name cannot state (see its note for why it is here and not in
 *     `font-utils.ts`).
 *  2. **A lookalike is never the font.** `googleMatch` returns a Google family
 *     only when it IS that family under a different spelling. Arial is metric
 *     compatible with Helvetica; it is not Helvetica, so asking for Helvetica
 *     returns null. See METRIC_LOOKALIKES.
 *  3. **"unknown" stays unknown.** `describeFaceSource` reports the subset and
 *     embedding facts a source actually stated and invents nothing to fill a
 *     gap. Absence of a licence signal is itself the signal.
 *
 * Known limitation, stated rather than papered over: a family whose own name
 * ends in a weight word parses that word as the weight. "Archivo Black" reads
 * as family "Archivo" at 900, because a catalogue-free parser cannot tell a
 * family word from a style word. Callers that have a
 * catalogue should try `googleMatch(raw)` on the whole spelled name FIRST and
 * fall back to `googleMatch(parseFaceName(raw).family)` - the test suite pins
 * that two step order.
 */

 * It lives in this module rather than in `font-utils.ts` for one reason: that
 * file's `FontMetadata` is a fixed-shape record with a dozen readers (the upload
 * validator, the font registry, the brand editor, the export path), and widening
 * it would change what all of them get. This is an ADDITIVE read, used by the two
 * callers that care - the bytes install path and the compare stage.
 *
 * Pure and defensive: a truncated table, a nonsense axis count or a range CSS
 * cannot express all return null rather than a half-read number. Only an sfnt is
 * readable - a WOFF/WOFF2 wrapper hides the table directory, exactly as it hides
 * `OS/2` from `readFontEmbedding`.
