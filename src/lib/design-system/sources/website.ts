/**
 * The **website source** (plan 97 section 9, M6) - a first-party site as design-system
 * material, on the two shells that can actually read one.
 *
 * section 9's decision is the structure of this file: **no server fetch, ever**. The
 * deployed PWA cannot reach an arbitrary origin at all (`connect-src` allowlists
 * six hosts, so this dies at CSP before CORS is even asked), and `api/ingest`
 * was ruled out rather than built. So the reading is done by whatever on-device
 * transport the person already has:
 *
 *  - **Tauri** - a native fetch (the Rust `site_fetch` command), which has no
 *    CORS or CSP to answer to. Probed two ways, because one of them can miss:
 *    an optional bridge member a shell's `bridge-overrides` may add, and - the
 *    one that cannot miss - Tauri's own `__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke` global.
 *    A build-time override keyed on a FILENAME has silently failed in this repo
 *    before, and here it would fail OPEN: no throw, just a tile that never
 *    appears on the one platform it is meant to work on. The runtime probe owns
 *    no filename, so a rename cannot break it.
 *  - **Chromium + the Lolly extension** - the capture extension already holds
 *    `debugger`/`tabs` + `<all_urls>`; alongside its PNG capture it answers a
 *    site request with the rendered page's HTML, stylesheet text and asset
 *    bytes. **The wire protocol for that lives in exactly one place** - 
 *    `bridge/capture-extension.ts`, beside the `capture` request that shares the
 *    relay - and this module adapts it rather than restating it. It restated it
 *    once, disagreed with the shipped extension on both the request type and
 *    the reply's shape, and the only symptom was a 60 s wait ending in
 *    "{host} took too long to answer": a wrong answer that blames the site.
 *
 * `detectSiteTransport` returns `null` when neither exists, and that null is the
 * whole gate: **the Website tile is not rendered otherwise**. Never show someone
 * a source they cannot use.
 *
 * Three lines the module holds to:
 *
 *  1. **Nothing is fetched before a press.** This module has no boot-time work
 *     and no ambient behaviour; `scanWebsite` fetches once, for the address it
 *     was handed. A `?source=url&u=` deep link only prefills - it never reaches
 *     here on its own.
 *  2. **First-party only, no crawling.** One address, one page, whatever the
 *     transport resolved for it. Links are not followed; the only sub-resources
 *     read are the stylesheets and candidate logo bytes the transport already
 *     resolved for that one page.
 *  3. **Machine reasons, never a throw.** Every failure comes back as a
 *     `refused` result with a token the caller renders through its own `t()` - 
 *     the same stance as `sources/pdf.ts`. A source picker that throws on a
 *     hostile page is a source picker that loses the press.
 *
 * The parsing itself is not here: `extract-site.ts` is the pure HTML/CSS →
 * census reader, and this module is the transport seam around it - address
 * validation, the fetch, pairing logo bytes onto the URLs the parser found, and
 * the section 9 bonus of feeding a screenshot through the image census so colours
 * painted by a webfont or a canvas (which no stylesheet declares) are seen too.
 *
 * Everything with judgement in it is a pure exported function taking plain data,
 * so it runs under bare node; the transports are injected, so the tests use
 * fakes and no test ever needs a browser, an extension or a network.

 *     knows something this module does not.
 *  2. Tauri's `__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke` global → the `site_fetch` command.
 *     The build-time override that was supposed to supply (1) is keyed on a
 *     FILENAME and there is no web-shell file with that name, so it never fires
 * - and its failure mode is silence: no throw, just a Website tile that
 *     never appears on the two shells the capabilities page names as the way to
 *     get one. A probe that owns no filename cannot miss that way.
 *  3. The extension, if it announced a site protocol this build speaks.
