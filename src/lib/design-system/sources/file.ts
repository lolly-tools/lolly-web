 * The **design-file source** (plan 97 §8, M2) — everything the import flow needs
 * to decide what a dropped file IS, and everything the semantic-mapping card
 * needs once that file turns out to be a token document.
 *
 * Pure and DOM-free on purpose. `views/start.ts` owns the copy, the markup and
 * the install; this module owns the sniffing, the zip shapes, the "does this doc
 * still need roles" question and the alias write. That split is what makes the
 * shapes testable under bare node — the flows they replace were 200 lines of
 * branching inside one `handleImportFile` closure with no coverage at all.
 *
 * Nothing here reports user-facing text. A refusal comes back as a machine
 * `reason` and the caller renders it through its own `t()`, so this module never
 * has to reach for the i18n runtime and one refusal can read differently in two
 * places (the modal card, the rail note) without a second code path.
 *
 * Four public jobs:
 *
 *  1. {@link routeDesignFile} — name/type/byte sniffing over the five shapes the
 *     picker accepts, including the zip of loose token-set files that
 *     `assembleTokenSetFiles` has always read for the CLI and the web could
 *     never open.
 *  2. {@link docNeedsMappingReview} — the gap that leaves an installed palette
 *     with every `--brand-*` var dark, plus the card's own model:
 *     {@link colorTokenRows} (what it can offer), {@link chooserRows} (what it
 *     shows) and {@link followRoles} (what follows the one decision it asks for).
 *  3. {@link censusFromTokensDoc} — a declaring source as a `DesignCensus`, for
 *     tray candidates ONLY. Read its caveat before reaching for it.
 *  4. {@link applyMappingChoice} — the chosen roles written as ALIASES onto the

 * routing a doc through it throws away the declared token PATHS — and paths are
 * exactly what `withRoleAliases` needs to write an alias rather than a literal.
 * **Never propose roles from this.** `proposeRolesFromTokens(doc, [], null)` is
 * the token-first proposer, it keeps the paths, and it is what the mapping card
 * (§3) runs. This function exists for the other half of §8: "review first",
 * where a doc decomposes into candidates the person adds one at a time, and a
 * candidate only ever needs a value and a provenance.
 *
 * Weights are declaration COUNTS, never invented usage: a colour declared once
 * weighs 1, and a hex declared twice under two names weighs 2 because that is a
 * fact the document states. Equal weights leave declaration order standing
 * (`candidatesFromCensus` sorts stably), which is the only ranking a document
 * offers and the only one honest to report.
 *
 * `source.kind` is `'css'`, the census's bucket for *declared* values as opposed
 * to painted ones — a DTCG doc and a fetched stylesheet are the same species of
 * evidence. A dedicated `'tokens'` kind would read better and belongs in
 * `census.ts`'s union the next time it opens; it is not user-visible in the tray
 * (candidates show `provenance.label`), so it is not worth widening a shared
 * type from here.
