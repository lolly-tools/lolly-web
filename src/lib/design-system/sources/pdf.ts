/**
 * The **PDF source** (plan 97 §8 gap 2, M5) — a guidelines PDF as design-system
 * material: the palette its artwork paints with, the marks themselves, and the
 * font programs it embeds.
 *
 * §8 states the shape of this milestone exactly: "`PdfHandle` is already
 * view-agnostic — the work is adapters + affordances, not extraction". So there
 * is no PDF parsing here at all. `views/pdf-import.ts` opens the document and
 * `listVectors`/`listFonts` do the reading; this module is the two things that
 * were missing between that handle and the tray — a census adapter, and the
 * per-candidate shaping (deduped faces with honest chips, a capped set of named
 * marks).
 *
 * Split in two on purpose:
 *
 *  - **The pure half** ({@link pdfScanToCensus}, {@link pdfFontCandidates},
 *    {@link pdfLogoPicks}) takes the handle's RESULT SHAPES as plain data and
 *    imports no PDF machinery whatsoever. It runs under bare node, which is what
 *    makes the fills aggregation, the face dedupe and the honesty chips testable
 *    without a fixture document and a pdf-lib load.
 *  - **The browser half** ({@link scanPdfForDesignSystem}) is the only part that
 *    touches a file. It lazily imports `openPdfFile`, feature-detects the two
 *    optional handle methods, and returns a machine `reason` on every failure —
 *    a dropped PDF must never throw into the source picker.
 *
 * Copy is the caller's, as in `sources/file.ts`: refusals and progress come back
 * as machine tokens the caller renders through its own `t()`. The one exception
 * is a mark's default `name`, which has nowhere else to be formed (see
 * {@link pdfLogoPicks}).
 *
 * **Nothing leaves the device.** The whole read is local — no network call is
 * made or possible from this module.

 *    are occurrence counts. A font table has none — a face embedded for one
 *    footnote sits beside the display face with identical evidence — so every
 *    family weighs the same and the ranking stays honestly flat.
 *  - **`usage` stays `'unknown'`.** The sibling adapters read a role off a
 *    design tool's own text runs. Nothing here saw a text run; which face is the
 *    heading face is a question about the pages, and the Type room asks it.
 *
 * `name` comes only from a title the document actually carries. The file name is
 * NOT a fallback: it is provenance (the census `label`), and promoting it to a
 * name would propose "brand-guidelines-v4-FINAL" as somebody's design system.
