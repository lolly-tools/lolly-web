/**
 * The Versions panel - publish, activate, restore (plan 97 section 6a, M7).
 *
 * A foot-pinned panel rather than a room, because versioning acts on the WHOLE
 * design system rather than on one part of it, and because a studio that has
 * never published must not carry a sixth room advertising machinery it does not
 * need. `views/start.ts` hides its rail entry until `hasPublishableSystem()`
 * says there is something to publish (or a `?area=versions` link asks for it
 * directly), which is plan 97 section 5's "hidden until the system has content".
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE OWNS: the copy, the markup and which press calls what. Every
 * byte that reaches disk goes through `../versions-io.ts`, which goes through
 * `installUserTokens` - the one write chokepoint, where immutability is
 * actually enforced. Nothing here writes an asset itself.
 *
 * THE HONESTY RULES this panel is built around:
 *   - **A version is permanent, and the panel says so before the press**, not
 *     after. There is no delete in v1, so the storage line states what has been
 *     kept and that it stays kept, rather than offering a button that lies.
 *   - **Removals lead the compat card.** Added and changed tokens are news;
 *     a removed one is the thing that breaks a tool, so it is named first and
 *     called what it is.
 *   - **Publishing is not undoable; restoring is.** "Restore latest from this
 *     version" is an ordinary edit to the head, so it lands on the studio's undo
 *     stack and the panel offers the Undo straight away.
 *
 * ONE RAW-HTML SINK: `paint()` re-renders the whole panel from the pure
 * `versionsHtml(model)`. Everything after that - the live slug line, the error
 * line, the busy states - is `textContent`, `disabled` or `hidden`, never
 * markup. That is also why the label field's feedback is computed from the
 * in-memory ledger rather than from `publishPreview`: a repaint on every
 * keystroke would take the caret with it.
 *
 * ESC: the panel is not an overlay, so there is nothing here that Esc could
 * cancel into a commit. `collapse()` folds an open disclosure and reports it,
 * which is how the view's Esc stack (tray → palette sheet → leave) gets a rung
 * here without a publish ever being one keypress from happening.
