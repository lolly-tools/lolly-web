/**
 * The candidate tray's SURFACE (plan 97 §8, M2) — the panel over `tray.ts`.
 *
 * `tray.ts` is the model: what a source scan found, persisted, deduped, and
 * never committed to anything. This module is the one place a person can see
 * that list and act on it. The split is the point — the model is testable under
 * bare node and outlives any view, the surface is DOM-bound and disposable.
 *
 * ONE DOM, TWO LAYOUTS. From 641px up it is a dock: a small fixed panel parked
 * on the inline-end edge, opened from the studio rail and closed when you are
 * done with it. At 640px and below the same element is a bottom sheet with the
 * palette sheet's peek/half/full grip (lib/mobile-sheet.ts). CSS decides which,
 * so nothing re-renders across the breakpoint; JS only attaches the sheet driver
 * while the media query actually matches. Sheet and grip are DIRECT children of
 * `.start` — the same specificity contract mountPaletteSheet documents, and the
 * reason styles/parts/tray.css writes its fixed-position rules at `.start > …`.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE COMMITS ANYTHING BY ITSELF. Every add is a press, one candidate
 * at a time, through the room that owns that material: a colour goes through the
 * Colours room's own add path (`ctx.addColors`, one call per candidate, so one
 * add is one token), a family through the Type room's installer, a name through
 * the head document. A candidate type with no handler renders with Dismiss and
 * NO Add button rather than a dead control or a promise about a later milestone
 * — plan 97 §9, never show something that cannot be used.
 *
 * The tray closes itself when its last pending candidate leaves (added or
 * dismissed): an empty tray is an empty concept, and advertising one is exactly
 * what §9 rules out. `open()` refuses for the same reason — a rescan that finds
 * nothing new must not raise an empty panel.
 *
 * KEYBOARD. Every action here destroys the control that ran it: the list is one
 * innerHTML write off the model's subscription, so the button under the cursor
 * is a different node a tick later. `render()` therefore remembers what had
 * focus and puts it back — on the same control when it survives, on the row that
 * took its place when it does not. The panel is a disclosure of the rail's tray
 * toggle: it carries an id the toggle points `aria-controls` at, opening from
 * that press moves focus inside, and closing hands focus back to where it came
 * from. DOM order cannot carry that relationship (the panel is a fixed dock
 * appended last, after the whole studio), which is exactly why the programmatic
 * pair and the focus moves are not optional here.
