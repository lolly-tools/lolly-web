 * "which room, and is anything asked to be open on arrival". Three read-only
 * flags come out of the query string; the view consumes them on mount and
 * never propagates them into a generated link (plans/43).
 *
 * Pure and DOM-free: the resolution table is the part worth testing, and it is
 * the part that carries the back-compatibility promise — `?tab=` was the step
 * param for the whole life of the stepped flow, and links to it exist in the
 * dashboard, in the docs and in whatever people bookmarked.

 * the whole design system rather than on one part of it, it hides itself until
 * there is something to publish, and it has no editor panel behind it. It is
