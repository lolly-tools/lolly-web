/**
 * Neutral capture state — the pin an automated screenshot run sets so a baseline
 * shows the app's plain chrome, never a device's own preferences.
 *
 * A published screenshot is documentation: it has to show what a reader will see,
 * and it has to be byte-stable run to run. Two things fight that. Fresh browser
 * contexts handle most of it (no localStorage ⇒ no theme, no a11y prefs), but a
 * DEFAULT is not the same as absent:
 *
 *   - Jelly effects (`jelly-effects`) default ON for an unlocked brand — which is
 *     exactly the neutral `lolly-start` profile the docs pipeline captures under.
 *     So the soft-body controls were in every baseline by default, not by choice.
 *   - The a11y prefs (reduce motion / high contrast / large text) are canonical on
 *     the PROFILE, so a seeded or restored profile can turn them on before paint.
 *
 * Seeding `localStorage` alone cannot fix the first: `hydrateFeatureFlags()`
 * REWRITES the whole flag mirror from the profile at boot, so anything written
 * before then is discarded. Hence this pin: one key, read once after hydration,
 * forcing the effect flags off and the a11y attributes clear. It only ever turns
 * things OFF — there is no state it can switch on — so it is safe for the pin to
 * be un-gated, and it is set by exactly one caller (scripts/build-docs-shots.ts's
 * CAPTURE_INIT init-script, asserted against this module by
 * tests/docs-shots-capture-state.test.ts).
 *
 * The OS-level half of the same problem (`prefers-color-scheme`,
 * `prefers-reduced-motion`, `forced-colors`) is not storage at all and is pinned
 * by the capture context itself — see CAPTURE_CONTEXT in build-docs-shots.ts.

 *
 * Why this is needed on top of stilling the timers: freezing motion makes the LAYOUT
 * deterministic, but not the CONTENT. A tile whose preview had decoded in one run and
 * not in the next produced a ±25% swing in the serialised SVG — the walker embeds the
 * image it can see. Raster baselines absorbed that in their `tolerance=` pixel budget;
 * a vector baseline compares exactly, so "nearly loaded" is a different file.
 *
 * Lazy images are forced eager first, and that is the load-bearing detail: an offscreen
 * `loading="lazy"` tile never loads at all, so waiting on `complete` would hang forever
 * and `waitSelector` would time out. Forcing them makes the wait terminate AND makes the
 * set of decoded images the same every run. Errors resolve like loads — a broken preview
 * must not stall a capture, and it is equally broken in every run.
