/**
 * Lolly's own MilkDrop presets, seeded from the active brand's palette.
 *
 * Why author our own instead of shipping the stock butterchurn preset library:
 *
 *  1. COLOUR. Two thirds of the ~1750 converted community presets compute their
 *     final colour inside an HLSL `comp` shader, and another third assign the
 *     colour variables from their own per-frame equations — so overriding a
 *     preset's `baseVals` colours (the only hook there is) gets silently ignored
 *     by most of them. A brand-coloured visualizer has to come from presets whose
 *     equations we wrote.
 *  2. PROVENANCE. The `butterchurn-presets` package's MIT notice covers the
 *     converter; the presets themselves are community MilkDrop works, mostly
 *     without an explicit licence. Ours carry no such question.
 *  3. NO `new Function`. `loadPreset` only string-compiles equations when
 *     `init_eqs` isn't already a function (butterchurn 2.6.7) — so authoring the
 *     equations as REAL functions means the whole visualizer runs without
 *     `unsafe-eval`, keeps type-checking, and stays lintable like any other module.
 *  4. WEIGHT. Five presets as code cost a couple of KB; the stock packs are 12 MB.
 *
 * Colour is SEEDED, not reproduced — see lib/viz-palette.ts. Each preset closes
 * over the palette and walks it per-frame, so the same preset reads green under
 * SUSE and reads whatever the loaded brand is otherwise.
 *
 * MilkDrop variable conventions used below: `bass`/`mid`/`treb` (and the smoothed
 * `*_att`) sit near 1.0 at average loudness and climb with energy; `time` is
 * seconds; `decay` is feedback persistence (higher = longer trails); `zoom` > 1
 * flows outward, < 1 inward.
