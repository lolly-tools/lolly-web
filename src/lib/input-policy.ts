 * input-policy — a generic per-input display-policy registry for the tool sidebar.
 *
 * The sibling of lib/field-policy.ts, one level up: where field-policy governs the
 * profile form's fixed fields, this governs a tool's declared inputs. A neutral
 * seam the sidebar renderer consults when building an input control: should this
 * input render as usual, be locked to a read-only value, be hidden entirely, or
 * have its choices narrowed to an allowed set?
 *
 * Keyed by (toolId, inputId) — a tool's inputs are namespaced by the tool, and the
 * registry mirrors that so a policy for one tool can never bleed into another. It
 * is EMPTY by default, so `getInputPolicy` returns `undefined` and the sidebar
 * renders exactly as it does today; this primitive is dormant until a setter runs.
 *
 * Like field-policy, it knows nothing about WHERE a policy comes from: a
 * deployment's optional org-config module populates it (see src/org/), but the
 * registry is a standalone primitive with no dependency on that. The human-readable
 * `note` arrives already localised from whoever sets the policy, so this file needs
 * no i18n and no product vocabulary.
 *
 * This is a RENDERING overlay only. The engine input model stays the single source
 * of truth — nothing here mutates it; the sidebar reads a policy alongside the
 * model and adjusts how it presents the control.
