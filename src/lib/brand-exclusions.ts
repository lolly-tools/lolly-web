 * A LEAF module on purpose: the boot-path tokens bridge (bridge/tokens.ts)

 * one read through the studio's doc-surgery module (lib/brand-doc.ts, which
 * pulls the @lolly/engine barrel) would invert the bridge→lib layering and
 * drag studio code into the bridge's static boot graph. This file imports
 * nothing beyond the engine's tokens leaf, which the bridge already rides;
 * brand-doc.ts re-exports it so studio callers keep one import site.
