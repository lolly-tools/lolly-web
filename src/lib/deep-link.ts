/**
 * The lolly:// scheme, mapped onto the app's own routes (plans/174).
 *
 * A deep link is an app address with the site name taken for granted:
 * `lolly://<route>` is `https://lolly.tools/<route>`, and it is the string an OS
 * hands the installed app - a Raycast or Alfred "open URL" action, `open` /
 * `xdg-open` / `start` in a terminal, a .desktop Action, a GNOME Shell or KRunner
 * result, an Android or iOS link tap. Three sources feed it (the desktop poll loop
 * in linux-desktop-boot.ts, the Android LollyShare bridge and the iOS queue behind
 * drop-router.ts's initDeepLinkIntake) and all of them route through here, so the
 * grammar is decided once.
 *
 * `web+lolly:` is the same address in the one spelling a browser will hand an
 * installed PWA: a web app may only register a scheme in the `web+` namespace, so
 * the manifest's protocol_handlers entry claims `web+lolly` and the browser opens
 * `/?deep-link=web+lolly://…`. The prefix is stripped here and nothing else
 * changes - one grammar, two spellings, and a fourth source feeding it.
 *
 * The rule: a deep link may only open a route the app already owns. Tool forms
 * go through the engine's own recogniser (parseToolUrl: `t/<id>`, `tool/<id>`,
 * `tool/<id>.<ext>` and a bare `<id>`); everything else must start with a word
 * from APP_PATH_WORDS, the frozen route vocabulary of plan 171. A link that is
 * neither is refused with null, never forwarded. An OS-delivered string is
 * untrusted input, and "navigate wherever it says" is how a crafted link would
 * reach a route that was never meant to be linkable.
