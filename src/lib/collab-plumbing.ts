/**
 * collab-plumbing - the transport-blind seam between ONE mounted tool's runtime and
 * a registered collaboration provider (plan 100 §5, wave 0.5).
 *
 * INERTNESS IS THE CONTRACT. `attachCollabPlumbing` asks `getCanvasSyncProvider()`
 * for an adapter and returns `null` when there is none - it does not wrap
 * `runtime.setInput`, does not schedule a frame, does not read IndexedDB, does not
 * mint an id. With no provider registered (this repo ships none - plans/99 §1.1)
 * a tool mount is byte-identical to single-player, and its co-located test proves
 * that with a call-count spy rather than by inspection.
 *
 * The two directions, per §5:
 *
 *  - OUTBOUND. mountTool already wraps `runtime.setInput` once for undo history - 
 *    the one chokepoint every control and every canvas commit flows through. We wrap
 *    that wrapper, so a local edit becomes ops for the adapter. A history REPLAY
 *    (undo/redo) is a local edit and syncs like any other: it is just another LWW
 *    write (§5, §11.15). Only a remote apply is excluded. Deliberately NOT wrapped:
 *    `runtime.setInputNoHistory`, the escape hatch for writes that are not user
 *    edits - deck slide navigation through it is *location*, which is a presence
 *    field (§4.2), not a document write, and forcing every peer to my slide is the
 *    bug that would cause.
 *
 *  - INBOUND. `applyRemotePatch(ops)` coalesces per animation frame and lands the
 *    batch through `runtime.applyPatch` - the engine's atomic multi-input apply
 *    (§5). That path never re-enters `setInput`, so remote values (a) cannot record
 *    an undo step and (b) cannot echo back out as ops. The `applyingRemote` guard is
 *    belt-and-braces for a future refactor that routes it differently, and is held
 *    only across the SYNCHRONOUS part of the apply (see flush()). The VALUES in that
 *    patch come from the adapter's post-apply `state()`, never from `op.value` - the
 *    ops say which keys the batch touched, the document says what those keys now
 *    hold. See {@link ConvergedRead} for why reading the payload instead makes two
 *    peers' documents converge while their models permanently diverge.
 *
 * WHAT CROSSES THE SEAM (plan 100 §3, plans/99 §7):
 *  - a scalar input → one `ParamOp` keyed by the input id;
 *  - a `blocks` input → the box ops, scoped by `col` = the input id (v1.1), keyed by
 *    the row's stable ULID (lib/row-id.ts), with geometry fields on the geometry
 *    lane via the contract's own `laneForField`/`damageToOps`.
 * Object-valued inputs (asset refs, `vector`, `table`, `file`) do NOT: `ParamValue`
 * and `BoxRow` are scalar by contract, and file bytes/live frames are excluded
 * outright. A blocks row's non-scalar fields are simply not projected, so they are
 * neither sent nor clobbered by an inbound rebuild.
 *
 * TWO CONTRACT GAPS, worked around here and reported rather than papered over:
 *  1. `CanvasSyncAdapter` has no local entry point for a `param` write, and none for
 *     a gesture the adapter's own differ never sees. `onLocalChange` takes a row MAP,
 *     so the shell decides which gestures reach it: a pure REORDER changes no row, so
 *     it does not, and the shell mints the `OrderOp`s itself from the runtime's array
 *     (which is the order truth - an adapter's document can lag it). Both kinds are
 *     delivered through `apply()`, the contract's single-op door (`applyRemotePatch`
 *     being explicitly the REMOTE door). An adapter that DOES emit order ops of its
 *     own is honoured instead (the guard in emitCollection) - the contract's
 *     `damageToOps` now restates order whenever the sequence changed. A future v1.2
 *     may want an explicit `onLocalOps(ops)`.
 *  2. Ops the adapter mints carry ITS Lamport clock, ops we mint carry ours. We
 *     absorb every clock we see (`observeClock`) before minting, which is the
 *     Lamport rule and is what keeps a shell-minted OrderOp strictly newer than the
 *     adapter-minted AddOp it must override.
 *
 * No wall clock anywhere in this file: ordering is `(clock, client)` only, so an
 * airgapped device with a wrong clock converges identically (§11.7).
