/**
 * collab-tile-state - a generic registry for an EXTERNAL source of live-collab
 * PRESENCE, keyed by saved-session slot, plus the pure DOM renderer that paints it
 * onto a Projects grid tile (plan 100 §4.6, §4.8; wave 1.5).
 *
 * Mirrors `session-source.ts`'s shape exactly (see its header for the pattern this
 * follows): a neutral seam the Projects view consults so a tile can show "who's in
 * here right now" without knowing whether that answer came from a Track A peer
 * connection, a Track B room, or nothing at all. It is EMPTY by default, so
 * `getCollabTileProvider()` returns undefined and `renderCollabBadge` is called
 * with an empty peer list - which paints NOTHING (see below) - so every tile in
 * this repo renders exactly as it did before this file existed.
 *
 * THERE IS NO LIVE PROVIDER YET. Track A's ceremony (wave 2.x) and Track B's org
 * adapter (wave 3.x) are what will eventually call `registerCollabTileProvider`,
 * the same way `src/org/index.ts`'s member branch calls `registerSessionSource`
 * today. Until one of them does, this seam is inert - a single registration slot
 * (last-wins), the same convention as every other optional-provider seam in this
 * codebase (`canvas-sync-provider.ts`, `session-source.ts`).
 *
 * WHY A PULL MODEL. `peersFor(slot)` is synchronous and called at TILE RENDER
 * time (Projects' `wire()`, after every `viewEl.innerHTML` rebuild) rather than
 * the badge subscribing to a push feed itself. A provider that wants live updates
 * mid-view (a peer joining while the Projects grid is open) re-renders through
 * its own means - most naturally by triggering the same `wire()`/`render()` path
 * the view already re-runs on every data change - so this module stays exactly
 * what it says: a registry plus a renderer, no timers, no subscriptions, no DOM
 * beyond the one tile it's handed.
 *
 * ── Copy ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * FOUR strings, and all four are BOOT-catalog copy rather than the lazy `collab`
 * namespace: the badge's `aria-label` in its two count forms, plus the two an avatar's
 * hover `title` needs (the stand-in for a peer who sent no name, and the away suffix).
 * `renderCollabBadge` is synchronous and Projects calls it once per tile on every
 * render pass, so there is no await to load a namespace from - and a screen-reader-only
 * string is the last place an English fallback is acceptable.
 *
 * Every one of them is a literal `t()`/`tRaw()` argument, so scripts/translate.ts's
 * extractSpaKeys picks them up with no hand-list. `tRaw` rather than `t` throughout
 * because both sinks are text (`setAttribute`, and the `title` property), where an
 * escaped `{n}` or an apostrophe in a name would be read out as an entity.
