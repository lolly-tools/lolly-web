 * export-policy — a tiny, generic policy for what a tool may offer at export time.
 *
 * The third sibling alongside lib/field-policy.ts (profile fields) and
 * lib/input-policy.ts (tool inputs): where those govern how a control renders, this
 * governs the export/download AFFORDANCE. A neutral seam the tool view consults when
 * building its download control: may the caller download the result, must they route
 * it through an approval instead, or is output withheld entirely?
 *
 * It is a single slot, EMPTY (undefined) by default, so `getExportPolicy` returns
 * `undefined` and the export control renders exactly as it does today — this
 * primitive is dormant until a setter runs. `exportAffordance(undefined)` is
 * `'download'`, so the dormant path is byte-identical to a build without this module.
 *
 * Like its siblings, it knows nothing about WHERE a policy comes from: a deployment's
 * optional org-config module populates it (see src/org/), but the registry is a
 * standalone primitive with no dependency on that — a test or a future feature can
 * drive it just the same. It carries no product vocabulary and needs no i18n; any
 * user-facing copy is supplied by whoever consults it.
