/**
 * The MilkDrop visualizer's engine wrapper — everything WebGL and audio, nothing UI.
 * components/viz-overlay.ts owns the surface it draws into; this module owns the
 * butterchurn instance, the render loop, and the audio tap.
 *
 * Deliberately kept out of the initial bundle: `butterchurn` is ~40 KB gzipped and
 * only ever needed when someone actually opens the visualizer, so it arrives via a
 * dynamic import on first `mountViz()` and is cached by the module system after.
 *
 * AUDIO. It taps the EXISTING focus-loop graph rather than building its own:
 * `getNeurospicyAnalyser()` hands back the pass-through analyser that already sits
 * between the player's gain and the speakers (lib/neurospicy.ts), and its
 * `.context` is the AudioContext butterchurn needs. `connectAudio` adds a parallel
 * branch into butterchurn's internal delay tap — it never reaches the destination,
 * so nothing is heard twice — and `disconnectAudio` unhooks only that branch,
 * leaving analyser→destination intact. That means:
 *   - no second AudioContext, no autoplay-gesture juggling of our own;
 *   - the visualizer is dead until audio has actually started once (the analyser
 *     doesn't exist before then), hence `vizAudioReady()` and the retry the overlay
 *     does on 'lolly:neuro-playing';
 *   - internet radio DOES drive it: the stream's <audio> element is tapped into the
 *     same graph via createMediaElementSource (SomaFM sends the CORS header that
 *     needs), so a station looks exactly like a local track here. A station whose
 *     server refuses the tap falls back to untapped playback and reports
 *     'unanalysable' — `vizHasSignal()` is false then, and the overlay says why
 *     instead of looking broken.
 *
 * INJECTED AUDIO — the second mode. butterchurn's renderer takes per-frame
 * time-domain bytes when you hand it any (`render({ audioLevels })`), and only falls
 * back to reading its own AnalyserNode when you don't. That is what lets a tool drive
 * the same visualizer from a DECODED FILE (host.audio) rather than from live playback:
 * pass `opts.audio.frame` and there is no analyser, no AudioContext and no focus-loop
 * graph in the picture at all. Paired with `opts.driven` (no rAF loop of our own, one
 * frame per `renderFrame()` call) that makes the visualizer reproducible frame by
 * frame, which is what an offline video export needs.
 *
 * WebGL2 is a hard requirement of butterchurn 2.x, so every entry point here is
 * gated on `vizSupported()` from the dependency-free lib/viz-support.ts (which the
 * dock also reads, synchronously, to decide whether to show its button at all).
