 *
 * The three dialog seams it binds:
 *   - inviter: `onInvite` publishes the minted invite; `scan` pulls the reply.
 *   - acceptor: `scan` pulls the invite; `onAnswer` publishes the minted reply.
 * `scan` is the dialog's "get a signal from somewhere" affordance (a tap on the
 * waiting/paste screen), which here reads from the shared cloud rather than a
 * camera. Everything the rendezvous writes is ciphertext at a hashed path
 * (collab-rendezvous.ts); op-guard / identity binding stay wherever they are.
