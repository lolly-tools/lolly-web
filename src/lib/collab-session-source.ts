/**
 * collab-session-source - the registry a TRANSPORT registers itself in, so that a
 * mounted tool can become a collab without the tool view knowing what a transport
 * is (plan 100 §5).
 *
 * The exact sibling of `canvas-sync-provider.ts` (read its header first - this
 * mirrors it deliberately, down to the last-wins rule and the test-only clear), and
 * the two answer different questions. `canvas-sync-provider` hands over a
 * `CanvasSyncAdapter`: a convergence document, and nothing else. That is enough to
 * SYNC, which is what `collab-plumbing.ts` needs, and it is not enough to be IN a
 * collab: presence has a roster, a connection state, a chosen display name, a
 * palette slot and a leave frame, none of which an adapter carries. So a session
 * source hands over a whole {@link CollabSessionHandle} - the one thing
 * `createCollabSession` asks a transport for.
 *
 * ── WHY A FACTORY, NOT A HANDLE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A provider is registered once, for the app; a handle belongs to ONE mount. A
 * private collab is pinned to the session slot the ceremony was run from (§6.2a),
 * and an org room is pinned to a document - so the registrant is asked, per mount,
 * whether THIS tool on THIS slot is part of a live collab, and answers `null` for
 * every mount that is not. Returning `null` is the normal case even when a
 * transport IS registered: a user in a collab on one session still opens other
 * tools single-player.
 *
 * ── INERTNESS IS THE CONTRACT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing in this repo registers a source (it ships no server, no socket, and no
 * ceremony transport - plans/99 §1.1), so {@link acquireCollabSession} returns
 * `null` and every presence surface in `views/tool.ts` stays unbuilt. The dormant
 * path is deliberately *one function call, one truthiness test, and no allocation*
 * - which is why this takes positional arguments rather than the context OBJECT the
 * factory receives. A context literal built at the call site would be a per-mount
 * allocation charged to every single-player user forever, for a value nobody reads
 * (plan 100 §11.14's solo-cost discipline). The object is built here, after we know
 * somebody is listening.
 *
 * A factory that throws is a transport failing to start, not a reason to fail the
 * mount: it is caught, logged, and read as "no collab", so a broken provider costs
 * the user their collab and never their tool.
