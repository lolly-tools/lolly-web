 * Brand colours for audio waveform thumbnails — the "that song is the pink blob one"
 * layer.
 *
 * WHY COLOUR, when the shape already varies. Shape alone gives five identities, and
 * measurement showed that is not enough in practice: catalog music is loudness-
 * maximised, so most clips' peaks sit near 1.0 for most of their length and two tiles
 * of the same shape look near-identical at 100px. Colour is what makes a grid
 * scannable — a viewer recognises a tile before reading its label, and after a few
 * uses the pairing becomes a memory hook rather than decoration.
 *
 * IDENTITY IS MULTIPLICATIVE, WHICH IS WHY THE HASHES MUST NOT AGREE. Shape and
 * colour are derived from the same asset id but with DIFFERENT salts. Hash the id
 * once and reuse it and the two dimensions correlate perfectly — every blob comes out
 * the same colour, and five shapes × six hues collapses back to five identities
 * instead of thirty. The salts are what buy the multiplication.
 *
 * THIS DOES NOT BREACH THE HONESTY RULE. The hash chooses PRESENTATION — which form,
 * which hue — and never DATA. The bars' heights remain measured peaks or the tile
 * stays an honest glyph; nothing here invents a waveform, and nothing here may ever be
 * extended to. See lib/audio-thumb.ts's header for the rule itself.
 *
 * TWO CONSTRAINTS INHERITED FROM THE VISUALIZER WORK, both learned the hard way:
 *
 *   NEVER INVENT A HUE THE BRAND DOES NOT OWN. A monochrome or greyscale brand gets
 *   its variety from LIGHTNESS, not from a synthesised colour — a tile in a hue the
 *   brand has never used is off-brand, and "it looked nicer" is not a licence to
 *   repaint someone's identity. This is not an edge case: the lolly-start profile is
 *   nearly neutral, so it is the COMMON path here and wants testing first.
 *
 *   LEGIBILITY, JUDGED AGAINST THE SURFACE ACTUALLY PAINTED ON. A candidate is checked
 *   against the ACTIVE theme's tile background — not against both. Requiring both was
 *   tried first and is wrong, measurably: against SUSE it rejects the dark green
 *   (APCA Lc 100 on white, 0 on dark) and the off-white (0 on white, −97 on dark) —
 *   precisely the brand's most characteristic colours — leaving only mid-tones, which
 *   is the monotony this module exists to remove. A tile is only ever on one surface
 *   at a time, so that is what it must be judged against.
