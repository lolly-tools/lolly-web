/**
 * The "Available offline" download manager - the engine behind the profile
 * view's offline section.
 *
 * offline-pins.ts makes ONE TOOL a guarantee; this module makes the PROMISE a
 * guarantee: a user with an hour of airport wifi can pull down every part of
 * the app they'll need for a connectionless flight and watch a real progress
 * bar while it happens. Five downloadable parts, each landing in the
 * service-worker bucket (or store) that actually serves it offline:
 *
 *   app - the full build payload (dist/precache.json `app` group: every
 *             hashed /assets/ chunk incl. lazy views + locale chunks +
 *             HarfBuzz wasm, the bundled UI fonts, icons, share stubs) into
 *             the APP_CACHE bucket. Closes the biggest hole in the offline
 *             story: before this, a lazy chunk cached only if its code path
 *             ran while online.
 *   docs - the /info site (its manifest.json: the English pages, the
 *             shared screenshots, plus the active locale) into INFO_CACHE.
 *   verify - the deep-scan machinery: the onnxruntime-web runtime
 *             (precache.json `ort` group) into ORT_CACHE, plus the TrustMark /
 *             Content Seal models through their own IndexedDB fetchers
 *             (lib/trustmark.ts, lib/contentseal.ts). ~220 MB - opt-in.
 *   durable - the TrustMark ENCODER behind the export panel's "Durable
 *             credential" toggle (lib/trustmark-embed.ts), ~33 MB. It shares the
 *             'trustmark-models' IDB store with verify's decoders, so the two
 *             parts own their own KEYS there and neither clears the store.
 *   speech - the on-device voice models (Kokoro - plans/41-tts-stt-programme.md
 *             section 3): model/config/tokenizer files into transformers.js's OWN
 *             'transformers-cache' bucket under the exact request keys its hub
 *             probes (bridge/speech.ts cached() matches the same shape), voice
 *             style matrices into the worker's 'lolly-speech' bucket - the
 *             SAME caches the speech runtime reads, so a downloaded part means
 *             zero bytes move on first synthesis. Opt-in, like verify.
 *   catalog - brand/catalog assets beyond the core tier, whole or scoped by
 *             tag. The BYTES go through catalog/sync.ts's checksum-verified
 *             prefetch into the IDB blob cache (threaded in by the view, same
 *             cycle-avoidance as offline-pins' PrefetchAssets); this module
 *             owns the SELECTION (which tags / all), which sync.ts reads back
 *             at boot to keep those blobs out of the browsed-but-unsaved prune
 *             and refreshed with the core tier.
 *
 * (Tools stay offline-pins.ts's job - the profile section drives both.)
 *
 * Downloads are resumable and cancellable: every file already present (same
 * URL, and where sizes are known, same byte size) is skipped, so a dropped
 * connection or a cancelled run resumes from where it stopped, and a deploy
 * re-downloads only the delta (hashed /assets/ names miss the cache only when
 * their content actually changed). An AbortController threads through every
 * fetch. Part state (which parts are downloaded, at which manifest version)
 * persists in IndexedDB next to the pin map - device-local, never in the
 * portable backup.
 *
 * resyncOfflineParts() keeps a downloaded install current: called from the
 * boot idle path (catalog/sync.ts, beside the pinned-tool refresh), it
 * re-syncs any downloaded part whose manifest version watermark moved.
