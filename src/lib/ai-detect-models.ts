/**
 * On-device AI-text detector - the PURE catalogue half of plans/126 WP-A's
 * local-model tier, the structural twin of lib/reword-models.ts: constants
 * only, NO transformers.js, NO DOM - safe to import from the main thread (the
 * ai-detect facade, the views) or the worker.
 *
 * The file NAMES and byte counts are a PINNED CONTRACT shared verbatim with
 * scripts/fetch-ai-detect-models.ts (Andy-run - this repo never vendors
 * weights): the worker loads whatever that script writes under
 * `/models/ai-detect/<id>/`, via transformers.js's localModelPath.
 *
 * MODEL CHOICE (plans/126 WP-A; REVERSED at staging, 2026-08-21, on measured
 * evidence): the plan named the ModernBERT RAID+MAGE fine-tune primary on its
 * benchmarks, but calibration against the corpus + REAL local-LLM generations
 * found its top region saturated - a real SmolLM2 answer (0.9828) and the
 * corpus's NON-NATIVE-ENGLISH HUMAN sample (0.9829) are inseparable, so no
 * threshold both catches machine text and spares that writer. The e5-small
 * LoRA detector (MIT) separates cleanly on the same data (humans <= 0.46,
 * real LLM output 0.78-0.92) and is a fifth of the size, so IT is the staged
 * primary; ModernBERT stays exported + pinned, unstaged, awaiting a larger
 * calibration corpus. Rejected outright: desklib DeBERTa (size),
 * SuperAnnotate (copyleft), the 2019 OpenAI RoBERTa detectors (obsolete +
 * documented non-native-English bias), Binoculars / Fast-DetectGPT
 * (paired-LLM compute, not WASM-feasible).
 *
 * HONESTY CONTRACT (mirror this wherever the estimate surfaces): strong on
 * GPT-4/ChatGPT/Llama-era text, degraded under paraphrase or humanizer
 * attack, unquantified on the newest model generations - and low-perplexity
 * HUMAN prose (especially non-native English) can score high, which is why
 * the engine caps the model's evidence below 'strong' on its own
 * (`applyModelEstimate`) and the verdict renders as an estimate row, never in
 * the band heading.
