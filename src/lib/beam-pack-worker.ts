/**
 * Beam pack hashing worker (plan 100 §11.15a: "beam work stays off the main thread").
 *
 * Building a pack is one expensive step and a lot of cheap ones. The expensive step is
 * the SHA-256 over every file's bytes - a tag pack is tens of megabytes, and hashing it
 * on the main thread would stall the tab at exactly the moment a human is being shown a
 * "Send these 14 files?" sheet. Everything else the builder does (reading records,
 * shaping the manifest, slicing chunks on demand) is small or lazy, so this worker does
 * the one thing and nothing more.
 *
 * Why blobs, not bytes. A `Blob` structured-clones by HANDLE, so posting one here does
 * not copy its bytes across the boundary - the worker reads each blob and lets it go
 * before touching the next, which is what stops a 38 MB pack from being resident in the
 * renderer twice. Web Crypto has no streaming digest, so ONE item is materialised at a
 * time inside the worker; that is the memory profile §11.15a asks for, and the reason
 * this is a loop rather than a `Promise.all`.
 *
 * The digest itself is `sriSha256` imported from the protocol - deliberately the very
 * same function the receiver verifies with, so a worker build and a main-thread
 * fallback build can never disagree about the same bytes, and a checksum computed here
 * compares equal to one `scripts/checksum-assets.ts` wrote for a catalog asset.
 *
 * Failure is not this file's problem: any throw is reported back and `hashBlobs()` in
 * `beam-pack.ts` hashes in place instead. A dead worker degrades a build's smoothness,
 * never its result.
