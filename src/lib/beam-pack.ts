 * beam-pack — what a **Beam** actually carries, and what happens to it on arrival
 * (plan 100 §6.4, §11.15a, §11.16, §11.18, §11.24).
 *
 * `collab/beam-protocol.ts` is the wire: frames, consent, ordering, integrity. It
 * deliberately knows nothing about sessions, uploads or IndexedDB. THIS module is the
 * other half — the two ends that touch the user's own data:
 *
 *   - **build** (`buildBeamOffer`) turns a saved session, a hand-picked set of files,
 *     or "everything tagged *event-berlin*" into the protocol's offer + a byte source;
 *   - **ingest** (`ingestBeamItem`) turns one received item back into a row in the
 *     receiver's own library or a new session slot.
 *
 * ── The pack layout ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A beam is NOT a zip. §6.4 says "nothing new on disk format", and the backup bundle
 * (`data-transfer.ts`) already answers the shape question: metadata in one JSON part
 * (`assets.json`), each file's bytes in a part of their own (`assets/blobs/*`). A beam
 * is that same split, streamed instead of archived:
 *
 *   item 0        `lolly/beam-manifest`  the JSON manifest: kind, name, one entry per
 *                                        payload item, plus the by-reference entries
 *                                        that carry no payload at all
 *   items 1…k     one per user-local ASSET, the stored blob's bytes, verbatim
 *   items k+1…n   one per SESSION, the `SavedStateData` JSON
 *
 * Zipping would have cost the two properties the beam exists for. Byte-exactness: a
 * received asset's checksum has to equal the one the sender's catalog already holds,
 * or receiver-side dedup stops being a string compare and C2PA credentials stop
 * surviving the trip (§6.4). And streaming: the protocol discloses a per-item size and
 * stages each item as it lands (§11.15a), which a single archive member cannot do.
 *
 * **Assets before sessions is load-bearing, not tidiness.** A session's asset refs are
 * rewritten to the receiver's re-keyed ids at ingest (§11.18), so every asset a session
 * points at must already have landed — and the protocol sends items strictly in
 * declared order, so ordering them here is the whole mechanism.
 *
 * ── The closure rule (§11.16, stated so it can be tested) ─────────────────────
 *
 * "Send the assets this session uses" means exactly the ones the receiver could not
 * otherwise resolve. Walking the saved session JSON, every asset ref lands in one of
 * three buckets:
 *
 *   - `source: 'user'` (an upload, a recording, a capture) — **transferred**. These
 *     exist on one device only; without them the session renders broken refs.
 *   - `source: 'library'` (a catalog asset) — **listed by reference, never sent**, as
 *     an `asset-ref` entry marked `resolve: 'local'`. Two reasons, and only one is
 *     size: a catalog asset is brand-pack content, not the user's own work, so beaming
 *     it would push a private brand pack across a profile boundary that the receiver
 *     never opted into. A receiver on the same profile resolves it for free; a
 *     receiver on a different one gets the existing broken-ref affordance and the
 *     manifest says plainly which ids those were. That is §11.16's cross-profile
 *     honesty: the pack never pretends a cross-profile render will be faithful.
 *   - a **baked** ref (`meta.baked === true`) — nothing to do, its bytes ride inside
 *     the session JSON as a `data:` URL and resolve on any device.
 *
 * ── Ingest (§11.18) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   - **Ids are re-keyed.** A user-upload id is receiver-local, unlike the permanent
 *     catalog-id contract, so an arriving asset gets a fresh `user/beam/*` id and the
 *     session's refs are rewritten to match. Nothing on the receiver is addressed by
 *     a sender-chosen id, which also means a peer cannot aim a write at an id it
 *     guessed.
 *   - **Dedup by checksum.** An identical asset already in the library is reused: no
 *     second row, no second copy of the bytes, and the re-key map points the session's
 *     refs at the row that was already there.
 *   - **Sessions never overwrite.** A received session is a NEW slot, always, and its
 *     `__label` is suffixed "(from <name>)" so the library says where it came from.
 *   - **Byte-exactness.** Bytes are stored exactly as they arrived — no re-encode, no
 *     re-wrap, no downscale (which is why this does NOT go through the picker's
 *     `storeUserUpload`, whose whole job is normalising an unknown file). The digest
 *     is checked against the manifest before the write and, by default, re-read from
 *     the store and checked again after it, so "in === out" is asserted, not assumed.
 *     The ONE deliberate exception is markup (§11.22, below), which is sanitised —
 *     and markup is exactly the family that carries no C2PA hard binding, so nothing
 *     the byte-exactness rule exists to protect is inside it.
 *   - **Nothing the peer SAYS about a file describes the row.** See below.
 *
 * ── What a beam does not trust (§11.21, §11.22, §11.24) ──────────────────────
 *
 * The manifest is peer-controlled input, and the receiver's own device is what acts on
 * it. Three classes of manifest field were load-bearing on the receiving side and are
 * now derived from the BYTES instead, because a declaration is not evidence:
 *
 *   - **`type` / `format` / MIME.** Sniffed (`sniffFormat`/`sniffContainer`) from the
 *     received bytes. A peer-declared `type: 'audio', format: 'wav'` is exactly the
 *     shape `lib/tts-provenance.ts` re-arms the on-device speech credential heal on,
 *     which would have the receiver's own enrolled identity sign the SENDER's bytes as
 *     its own AI synthesis. Unsniffable bytes fall back to a whitelisted peer LABEL
 *     with the MIME forced to `application/octet-stream`, never `vector` — so no
 *     unrecognised blob can present as markup, and no object URL of one is executable
 *     in this origin.
 *   - **Provenance.** `credential`/`aiGenerated` are not on the wire at all. What a
 *     received file carries is read out of it here with the same `extractC2paStore`
 *     the upload path uses (`views/picker.ts`), so an AI origin can neither be
 *     laundered away by omitting it from the manifest nor asserted onto a photo that
 *     has none. The honest cost, stated: a sender whose record held a SIDECAR chain
 *     that no longer binds to its own stored bytes does not get that chain re-asserted
 *     on the receiver's device — re-asserting an unverifiable claim is the thing this
 *     is refusing to do.
 *   - **`meta`.** Bounded and key-filtered ({@link META_REJECTED_KEYS}): Lolly's own
 *     bookkeeping keys never arrive from outside, and no string value may carry a
 *     remote URL scheme — `views/catalog.ts` paints `meta.thumbUrl` straight into an
 *     `<img src>`, which would make accepting a beam an outbound beacon. The same rule
 *     governs a received session's `thumb`, which must be a `data:` image or nothing.
 *
 * And markup is sanitised. Bytes that sniff as SVG go through DOMPurify before they are
 * stored, exactly as an upload does (`views/picker.ts`'s "script bytes never reach
 * disk"), because a received SVG is later re-parsed and INLINED by the vector export
 * path — a peer's `<script>` would otherwise ride into a file the receiver exports
 * under their own name. The sanitiser is injected ({@link BeamSvgSanitiser}) and the
 * default fails CLOSED: a runtime with no DOM refuses the item rather than storing it.
 *
 * ── Where the heavy work runs (§11.15a) ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Hashing is the expensive part of a build (a tag pack is tens of MB) and it is the
 * one part that is pure and DOM-free, so it goes to `beam-pack-worker.ts`. The worker
 * imports the SAME `sriSha256` the receiver verifies with — one implementation, so a
 * worker and a fallback build can never disagree about the same bytes. Worker
 * construction failing (no `Worker`, a CSP that refuses it, a headless test) falls
 * back to hashing in place; the API is async either way, so no caller can tell.
