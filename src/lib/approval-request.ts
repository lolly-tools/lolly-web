 * approval-request — a generic seam for opening the "request approval" flow.
 *
 * The sibling of lib/share-sections.ts one purpose over: where that lets a feature
 * register EXTRA sections into the Share dialog, this lets a feature register the
 * opener for an approval-request flow, so the tool view can offer "Request approval"
 * without importing any of the machinery behind it. No opener is registered by
 * default, so `openApprovalRequest` is a no-op returning false and the view is
 * byte-identical until something registers one.
 *
 * It knows nothing about WHO registers the opener: a deployment's optional control
 * plane registers one that opens the approval dialog (see src/org/), but the registry
 * is a standalone primitive — a test or a future feature can drive it the same way.
 * The opener is handed a small, product-neutral context (the tool id, an optional
 * subject reference, and a default title) and owns everything else.
