/**
 * Portable user-data bundle — "take everything with you to another install".
 *
 * A long-term user accumulates real value on one offline device: their profile,
 * the sessions they've saved, the images they've uploaded, and their prefs. This
 * module packages all of it into a single `.zip` that can be carried (USB, AirDrop,
 * email-to-self, whatever) to a *second* offline install of the same app and loaded
 * back in. No server, no account — the file IS the transport.
 *
 * Storage-agnostic by design. Everything is read and written through the capability
 * bridge (`host.profile` / `host.state` / `host.assets`), so the SAME code produces
 * a byte-identical bundle on every shell even though the storage underneath differs
 * — the web PWA keeps saved sessions in IndexedDB, the Tauri shells keep them as
 * files on disk, and the bridge hides which is which. The transport package is the
 * contract; each shell's bridge is the per-platform adapter behind it.
 *
 * What travels:
 *   - profile        → profile.json   (the 'me' record, via host.profile)
 *   - saved sessions → sessions.json  (via host.state; thumbnails are data-URLs → JSON)
 *   - uploaded images→ assets.json    (metadata) + assets/blobs/* (bytes, via host.assets)
 *   - prefs          → prefs.json     (theme, sidebar width, local activity metrics)
 *
 * What does NOT travel: the catalog caches (asset-meta / asset-blob / catalog-meta)
 * and the tool index — all re-synced for free on the target device. Asset *references*
 * inside sessions/profile are kept by id; the bridge re-resolves them on load (it
 * already must, since blob: URLs don't survive a page reload), so once the uploaded
 * images are restored the references light back up on their own.
 *
 * The envelope is built to outlive this version (full spec: docs/data-transfer.md):
 *   - Forward-compatible — a reader gates on `manifest.minReader`, not the writer's
 *     `formatVersion`, so a future bundle that merely *adds* a part (e.g. design
 *     tokens) still imports its known parts on an older app; the rest is skipped.
 *   - Integrity-checked — `manifest.integrity` carries an SHA-256 per part, verified
 *     on import so a transfer mangled in transit fails loudly, not halfway.
 *
 * The `host` and the key/value `storage` (localStorage) are injected so the whole
 * round-trip can be exercised headlessly in tests against an in-memory bridge.
