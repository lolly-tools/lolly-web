 * How the Design System studio's website source stands on THIS device

 * feature that is gated by a transport rather than by a tool manifest:
 *
 *   'ready' - a transport exists (a Tauri shell's native fetch, or the
 *                   Lolly extension), so a page can actually be read.
 *   'install' - a Chromium browser with no transport: the extension can
 *                   fulfil this, exactly as it can fulfil `capture`.
 *   'unavailable' - anywhere else. There is no third transport to add later:
 *                   section 9's decision is that Lolly runs no fetching service, and
 *                   the deployed PWA's CSP cannot reach an arbitrary origin at
 *                   all, so this verdict is settled rather than pending.
 *
 * WHAT EACH VERDICT IS ALLOWED TO RENDER is the part worth writing down. Only
 * 'ready' puts a Website tile in the source picker - a disabled tile, or a
 * "get the app" teaser where the feature cannot run, is the dark pattern section 9
 * forbids. 'install' is documented on the capabilities surface
 * (lib/capabilities-data.ts → #/d?tab=caps), the same place every other gated
 * capability explains its unlock, so somebody who wants it can find out how and
 * nobody else ever trips over it.
 *
 * Transport DETECTION is not this module's business - it needs the host bridge,
 * and this file stays shell-agnostic - so the caller passes what it found
 * (lib/design-system/sources/website.ts's `detectSiteTransport`).
