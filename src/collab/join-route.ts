 * join-route - the two URL entry points of a private collab, and the platform
 * composition both ceremony roles share (plan 100 §6.1 skin 1, §11.25, §11.26; wave 2.4).
 *
 * `components/collab-ceremony.ts` owns the screens and imports no platform. `collab/`'s
 * other modules own one platform piece each (the codec, the machine, the transport, the
 * QR). Nothing joined them up: the invite the dialog mints points at `#/join?inv=…`, and
 * until this file there was no `#/join`. This is the wiring, and it is deliberately the
 * only place that knows all four names at once.
 *
 * ── The two routes ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **`#/join?inv=<token>`** - the acceptor's front door. It checks the `private-collab`
 * flag, reads the token, and refuses honestly when it cannot (§11.21: this is a
 * stranger's link, so an unreadable one gets a plain error screen, never a thrown view).
 * It opens the ACCEPTOR ceremony with the invite already delivered. The human pasted it
 * by clicking the link, so making them paste it again would be pointless.
 *
 * **`#/join` with no `inv` at all** - the same door for the other skin. An invite is a
 * link OR a code (§6.1), and the code half had nowhere to go: this route used to say
 * "this link carries no invite" and stop. That is a true sentence, but a dead end for
 * the one person it was shown to: somebody holding a code from a chat message. So a
 * bare `#/join` is now a paste card (one field, one button), reachable from the Share
 * dialog's "Join with a code" as well as from the address bar. It FORKS NOTHING: the
 * text goes through the same `readSignal` call the URL token goes through, then walks
 * the same path, delivery included. `inv=` present but EMPTY still gets the old
 * refusal, because that is a link that was built and then damaged, and it is worth
 * saying so.
 *
 * ── The flag gate has two answers, not one (§6.3 enable-on-accept) ─────────────
 *
 * `private-collab` has been ON by default since 2026-08-10, so the ordinary arrival (a
 * fresh profile, a device that has never seen this feature) walks straight past this
 * gate into the ceremony. That is the whole point of the flip: an invite link is
 * received by someone who has never heard of the feature, and "turn it on in your
 * profile settings" used to dead-end the one moment they had a reason to care. Two
 * kinds of reader still reach the gate, and which branch they get depends on WHO
 * decided:
 *
 *   - **governed off** - a control plane HIDES the flag (`flagHidden`, meaning the
 *     org's `orgFlagGovernance` entry forces the value and no toggle exists for it).
 *     The organization decided, so the page says that, names it as the decider, and
 *     offers no button that would be a lie. A merely-defaulted flag is NOT this: an
 *     instance default the user could still change in their own profile leaves the
 *     decision with the user, so it takes the other branch.
 *   - **ungoverned** - nobody but the reader decides. Since the default is ON, this
 *     means they turned it OFF at some point (or their instance defaults it off
 *     without hiding the switch). They get the enable card: what a private collab is,
 *     in one paragraph, then "Turn on and continue" or "Not now". Turning it on writes
 *     the flag the way the profile toggle writes it (the profile record first, then
 *     the synchronous mirror), and falls straight through into the ceremony with the
 *     invite this route is already holding - no reload, no re-paste. The point is to
 *     offer, not to obey: an off switch someone chose is not a reason to dead-end
 *     them, and not a reason to quietly overrule them either.
 *
 * **The gate renders before the token is read, and that ordering is essential.** A
 * card that said "this invite is unreadable" to a flag-off reader would answer a
 * question about a stranger's link that nobody asked, and would let anyone probe which
 * tokens this build considers valid without ever turning the feature on. Both branches
 * paint the same card for a good invite and a mangled one; the verdict shows afterwards,
 * on the ordinary path, once the feature is actually on.
 *
 * **`#/join-reply?ans=<token>`** - §11.25's fix for the ceremony's weak point. The
 * answer leg is the awkward half: the invite travels as a link the inviter chose to
 * send, but the reply has to travel BACK, and a blob pasted into a waiting dialog is
 * where pairs give up. So the reply is a link too. Clicking it opens a tab that hands
 * the payload to the tab holding the invite dialog over a `BroadcastChannel`, then gets
 * out of the way. Both legs are then click-or-paste-or-scan.
 *
 * ── One more thing the channel is used for: "did I make this invite?" ──────────
 *
 * Testing an invite in two tabs of one browser is a legitimate thing to do (it is how
 * this ceremony is drilled), and the app said nothing about it, so a person doing it
 * had no way to tell "this works" from "this device is talking to itself". `#/join`
 * now asks, on the same channel and in the same vocabulary ({@link inviteAskMessage}),
 * whether a window here minted the invite it is opening, and puts one dismissible line
 * above the flow if one says yes.
 *
 * It is INFORMATION and nothing else, and everything about how it is wired follows
 * from that: the question goes out AFTER the ceremony is already open and running, it
 * is never awaited, and silence (no channel, no listener, a listener that is busy) gets
 * the same screen as "not mine". A note that could delay or refuse a join would turn a
 * true observation into a gate over a workflow that already works.
 *
 * ── Why the handoff is a BroadcastChannel and not something cleverer ───────────
 *
 * The two tabs are the same origin on the same device, which is exactly the one thing
 * `BroadcastChannel` does with no server, no permission prompt, and no storage write.
 * It is also honest about failure: a channel with nobody listening stays silent, and
 * silence within {@link REPLY_ACK_WAIT_MS} tells this tab to say "the invite window is
 * not open" instead of spinning. The reply tab NEVER assumes it worked; it waits for
 * an ack from the tab that actually took the payload, and that ack is posted only once
 * the dialog has LEFT its paste step (a refused reply is not a delivered one).
 *
 * ── Why the payload is offered before it is sent ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * A `BroadcastChannel` post reaches every other same-origin context, and an SDP answer
 * is a valid answer to any offer: a reply broadcast raw would be swallowed by every tab
 * holding an invite dialog, and the ones it does not belong to would feed a foreign
 * answer to their own ceremony and die on the connect watchdog. Nothing in the payloads
 * can correct that afterwards - a `kind: 'answer'` blob carries only the acceptor's own
 * connection material (`collab/sdp-codec.ts`), with no back-reference to the invite it
 * answers - so the correlation has to be made on the channel, in three steps:
 *
 *   1. this tab posts an OFFER carrying a fresh request id, and no payload;
 *   2. every window whose dialog could actually take a reply BIDS with an id of its own;
 *   3. this tab hands the payload to exactly one bid, addressed to it by id.
 *
 * A window that did not win is never sent the reply at all, so it cannot be poisoned by
 * one. Two bids inside {@link REPLY_BID_WINDOW_MS} means this device has more than one
 * invite waiting, and the reply belongs to exactly one of them: the tab says so and
 * leaves the code to paste, because guessing would break the ceremony it guessed wrong
 * about. Zero bids is the "nobody home" case that was always handled.
 *
 * The delivery itself drives the dialog's OWN paste path ({@link deliverReplyToDialog}):
 * fill the field, press the button. It is not a private back door into the machine: a
 * reply arriving this way is validated by the same `readSignal` call, shows the same
 * notice when it is wrong, and leaves the same trace on screen as one a human pasted.
 * The two selectors that path needs are the dialog's public DOM surface, pinned by a
 * test that renders the real dialog rather than trusting this comment.
 *
 * ── Both routes are cancellable, and stamp that BEFORE they wait ───────────────
 *
 * `#view` is one persistent element (`main.ts`), so a route that paints after the router
 * has moved on does not paint a stale page: it destroys the live one. Both mounts here
 * wait (for an ack, for a profile read, for a camera probe), so both assign their
 * `_cleanup` before the first `await` and re-check `leaving` after every one. A teardown
 * assigned late is worse than none at all: by then it lands on the NEXT view's element
 * and silently replaces that view's own teardown.
 *
 * ── The shared composition ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * {@link createCollabEffects} is the one place the three platform pieces meet: the RTC
 * transport (`collab/rtc-transport.ts`) supplies `createOffer`/`createAnswer`/
 * `applyRemote` plus the ICE events without which no ceremony ever reaches `connected`.
 * The local catalog supplies `checkTool`, the probe §6.1 requires BEFORE answering,
 * because peers send values and never code (§11.22), so a tool this device does not
 * have gets a refusal rather than a degraded join. It is a FACTORY, not a bundle: the
 * acceptor names itself after the probe, and `restart` must get a genuinely fresh peer
 * connection.
 *
 * ── Copy ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Same rule as the dialog: every user-visible string is in {@link STRINGS}, English for
 * now, batched into the wave-2.7 locale fan-out (§11.28). Peer-supplied text reaches the
 * DOM only through `textContent`.

 * Ask for an invite code, and resolve with the decoded invite.
 *
 * The other half of the front door. An invite is a link OR a code by design (§6.1's
 * three skins), and until this card the code half had no door of its own: a person
 * holding a code pasted out of a chat had nowhere to put it, because `#/join` without a
 * token said "this link carries no invite" and stopped. This is that missing field.
 *
 * **It forks nothing.** The text goes through the same {@link readSignal} call the URL
 * token goes through - same decoder, same skin sniffing, same kind check - and the
 * caller then walks the same path a link walks, right down to
 * {@link deliverInviteToDialog} re-delivering it as if pasted. Two doors, one corridor.
 *
 * The three failures are three different sentences, because they are three different
 * situations for the person in front of the screen:
 *
 *   - EMPTY is a slip; the notice sits beside the field they are still holding.
 *   - UNREADABLE is a truncated or mangled code; same, because the fix is another paste.
 *   - A REPLY is the one that needs a screen. It is not a broken code - it is a perfectly
 *     good one in the wrong window, and the person is one hop from where it belongs, so
 *     they are told where that is (and handed the field back).
 *
 * Resolves with the invite, or `null` when the router leaves. Like {@link offerEnable},
 * the wait IS the screen: nothing resolves it but a good paste or a teardown.
