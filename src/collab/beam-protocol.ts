/**
 * beam-protocol — the message and state layer for a **Beam**: an AirDrop-grade,
 * serverless hand-off of a saved session, a whole project, the user's own assets, or
 * a tag pack, over the direct channel the pairing ceremony already established
 * (plan 100 §6.4, §11.6, §11.15a, §11.18, §11.24).
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT. There is no `RTCDataChannel` here, no Worker, no IndexedDB,
 * no OPFS, no `fetch`, no DOM, and no wall clock. This module is pure logic: it
 * defines the frames two peers exchange and the two state machines that produce and
 * consume them. The transport, the staging store and the pack builder are all
 * **drivers** that sit outside and feed these machines — which is what lets the whole
 * protocol be exercised headlessly, byte-exactly, against an in-memory sink.
 *
 * That separation is not tidiness. §11.15a requires beam work to run off the main
 * thread with chunks streaming to staging as they arrive, and §11.18 requires a
 * cancelled transfer to leave nothing behind. Both are properties of the *driver* —
 * but they are only provable if the protocol never touches storage itself and never
 * decides on its own when to write. So:
 *
 *   - the sender is **pull-based** (`nextChunk()`), so the transport decides the
 *     pace. The `bufferedamountlow` integration point is "call nextChunk() again";
 *     nothing is ever pushed on a timer or a microtask of our own (§11.6);
 *   - the receiver writes through an injected `BeamSink` (`write`/`finalize`/
 *     `discard`), so the IDB/OPFS integration is a driver, not part of the protocol;
 *   - **every terminal path that is not `complete` calls `sink.discard()` exactly
 *     once** (§11.18: no partial ingest). Decline, protocol violation, peer cancel,
 *     channel death and `dispose()` all land there. That is one latch and one test,
 *     rather than an audit of every exit.
 *
 * ── The exchange ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   sender                                receiver
 *   ------                                --------
 *   offer  {kind,name,items[],totalBytes} ─▶   (shown to the human, sized)
 *                                        ◀─  accept {}   |   decline {reason}
 *   chunk  {itemIndex,seq,last}          ─▶   staged through the sink
 *   <binary payload frame>               ─▶
 *   …                                          (repeat, one pull per chunk)
 *   item-done {itemIndex,checksum}       ─▶   finalize + verify the digest
 *   …
 *   complete {}                          ─▶   phase 'complete'
 *   cancel {reason}                     ◀─▶   either side, at any moment
 *
 * A chunk is TWO frames — a JSON header immediately followed by its binary payload.
 * The channel that carries a beam is reliable-ordered (§11.6: beam gets its own
 * channel so a bulk transfer never queues ops or presence behind it), so the header
 * is guaranteed to arrive before its bytes. A payload with no pending header, or a
 * second header with no payload between, is a protocol violation — that pairing is
 * the only framing this needs, and it costs nothing on the wire.
 *
 * ── The consent gate (§6.4, §11.24) ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing transfers on pairing alone. The offer discloses kind, name, item count,
 * per-item labels and the exact byte total BEFORE anything moves ("Receive 'Berlin
 * pack' — 14 assets, 38 MB?"). Until `accept()` is called the receiver treats ANY
 * chunk header or binary frame as `unsolicited-bytes` — a typed protocol violation
 * that cancels and discards. A peer cannot push bytes at a device that has not said
 * yes, and the machine proves it rather than the UI promising it.
 *
 * ── Integrity (§6.4, §11.18) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Checksums are the catalog's own primitive: SRI `sha256-<base64>`, byte-for-byte the
 * form `scripts/checksum-assets.ts` writes and `bridge/assets.ts` verifies against, so
 * a received asset's checksum compares equal to the one the sender's catalog already
 * holds and receiver-side dedup-by-checksum is a string compare. Each item's digest is
 * stated twice — in the offer (so the receiver can dedup and skip before consenting)
 * and again in `item-done` (the digest of what was actually sent). They must agree,
 * and the staged bytes must match both; any disagreement is `checksum-mismatch` and
 * the whole beam is discarded, never partially ingested.
 *
 * The hasher is injectable for two reasons, and only one of them is tests. Web Crypto
 * has no streaming digest, so the built-in `sha256Hasher` retains each chunk until
 * `digest()` — O(item) memory, which is exactly what §11.15a says a 38 MB beam must
 * not do in the renderer. The escape hatch is `BeamSink.finalize()`: a driver that
 * holds the staged bytes anyway may return the digest from `finalize`, and that value
 * wins over (and is computed instead of) anything the hasher would produce — pass
 * `hasher: null` and the protocol buffers nothing at all. A driver that supplies
 * neither fails closed (`sink-failure`), never "verified" by omission.
 *
 * ── Untrusted discipline (§11.21 applied to bulk transfer) ───────────────────
 *
 * Every inbound frame is peer-controlled input from someone you paired with, and is
 * treated that way: one strict parser (`parseBeamMessage`) is the single door, with
 * caps on item count, name/label/id lengths, per-item and total byte sizes, chunk
 * size, and a wire-version equality check. `totalBytes` must equal the sum of the
 * declared item sizes exactly — a peer cannot disclose 2 MB and then send 2 GB. Item
 * indices advance strictly 0…n-1 and `seq` strictly +1 within an item, so neither
 * out-of-order nor replayed chunks can reach staging. Sizes are checked against the
 * DECLARED size on every payload, so an item cannot overflow what the human accepted.
 * Nothing peer-supplied is ever used as an object key (items are addressed by index,
 * ids only ever land in a `Set` for a uniqueness check), so the prototype-key class of
 * bug has no surface here. Every violation produces a typed `BeamCancelReason`, sent
 * to the peer and surfaced in state — never a thrown exception, never a silent drop.
 *
 * ── Ordering & versioning ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Items are sent strictly in declared order and an item's chunks strictly in seq
 * order; the receiver enforces both. `BEAM_PROTOCOL_VERSION` is checked for equality,
 * not range: a peer on another wire version gets an explicit `protocol-version`
 * refusal rather than a best-effort guess. No wall clock is read anywhere in this
 * file — a beam between two airgapped devices with wrong clocks behaves identically
 * (§11.7's rule, honoured here for the same reason).
