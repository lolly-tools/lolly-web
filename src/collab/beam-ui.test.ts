 * beam-ui — the door into the beam (plan 100 §6.4).
 *
 * `beam-session.test.ts` proves the four wires are connected. What it cannot prove is
 * that anything ever OPENS one: until this module, the whole beam stack shipped complete
 * and unreachable — no session created, no toast mounted, `sendCurrentSession` called by
 * nobody. So this suite pins the three properties that make it reachable:
 *
 *   1. the send path builds a real offer FROM THE LIVE STATE — a working copy that was
 *      never saved to a slot — and it round-trips into the receiver's library byte-for-
 *      byte, with its user upload, over a fake lane pair;
 *   2. the toast is mounted ONCE per collab (not once per beam: the session multiplexes
 *      the outgoing and the incoming direction onto one stream) and comes off on close,
 *      together with the container this module made;
 *   3. a refusal is a value, never a throw — a closed lane and an empty reader come back
 *      as `{ ok: false, reason }` so the caller can say something true;
 *   4. an ACCEPTOR's two hosts go in opposite directions — packed from the ephemeral
 *      working copy (§11.17), landed in the real library (§6.4). One host for both made
 *      the toast report a success that evaporated at teardown.
 *
 * The lane pair is `beam-session.test.ts`'s, narrowed to what a transport publishes: the
 * six-member bulk lane plus the `message` stream every lane is multiplexed onto. So there
 * is no `RTCPeerConnection`, no IndexedDB and no beam-protocol instance written by hand
 * anywhere here — and the assertions are still about real bytes landing in a real host.
 *
 * Run directly:
 *   node --import ./tests/css-stub.mjs --test shells/web/src/collab/beam-ui.test.ts
