/**
 * op-guard - the check every INBOUND collaboration message passes before it is
 * allowed to become state (plan 100 §6.3 + §11.21, wave 2.4).
 *
 * A paired peer is untrusted input, continuously (§11.22): the threat model equals
 * "opened a shared lolly URL", except the URL keeps arriving, forty times a second,
 * from a machine we do not control. Everything below the transport therefore assumes
 * the bytes are hostile until this module has said otherwise. It is the ONE place
 * that assumption is discharged; `collab-plumbing.ts` (the seam that turns ops into
 * a `runtime.applyPatch`) re-checks a couple of the same rules as defence in depth,
 * but it is not the boundary and must not be asked to be.
 *
 * FOUR LAYERS, in this order, because each one protects the next:
 *
 *  1. STRUCTURE - an iterative walk (never recursion: the guard must not be the
 *     thing that stack-overflows on a nested payload) enforcing JSON depth, array
 *     length, a per-payload visit budget and finite numbers, and killing `__proto__`
 *     / `constructor` / `prototype` own keys wherever they appear. Runs FIRST so ajv
 *     never recurses into a pathological shape.
 *  2. SCHEMA - the canonical `validateCanvasOp` from `@lolly-tools/core`: the SAME
 *     ajv-compiled `schemas/canvas-op.schema.json` lolly-work's gateway runs, so a
 *     private pair and an org room agree on op shape by construction (§6.3).
 *  3. MANIFEST WHITELIST - an own-property check against the tool's DECLARED inputs
 *     and blocks sub-fields. Both peers run the same tool from their own local copy
 *     (§11.22 - peers send values, never code), so anything the manifest does not
 *     declare has no legitimate sender.
 *  4. CAPS - per-value size, ops per message, and (via `recordAndCheckRate`) ops and
 *     presence frames per second.
 *
 * WHAT THE SCHEMA DOES NOT CATCH, measured rather than assumed - this is why layers
 * 1 and 3 exist at all. Every one of these validates CLEAN against the canonical
 * schema today, and every one of them is a real write on the other side:
 *
 *   - `{k:'geom', fields:{x: NaN}}` and `{x: Infinity}`. ajv's `type: "number"` is a
 *     `typeof` test; NaN and Infinity are numbers. They land as a box coordinate and
 *     poison every layout computation downstream (§11.11 names NaN explicitly).
 *   - `origin: {clock: Infinity}`. `type: "integer"` is `!(data % 1)`, and
 *     `Infinity % 1` is NaN, so it passes - an origin that wins every future LWW
 *     merge for the lifetime of the document. (NaN is caught by ajv; Infinity is not.)
 *   - `{k:'add', row:{"__proto__": null}}`. `row`'s `additionalProperties` is the
 *     scalar $ref, so ANY key is schema-legal - and `JSON.parse` makes `__proto__` an
 *     OWN property. The rebuild in collab-plumbing does `row[field] = value` on an
 *     object literal, where that key is the prototype setter, not data.
 *   - `{k:'field', field:'__proto__'}` and `{k:'param', key:'__proto__'}`. Both are
 *     just strings to the schema, and both become object keys downstream.
 *
 * FORBIDDEN KEYS DIE REGARDLESS OF ANY LIST. `__proto__`, `constructor` and
 * `prototype` are refused as op keys, as field names, as param keys and as
 * collection ids even if a manifest declares an input by that name - the whitelist
 * is a narrowing, never a permission (the enum/prototype-key discipline
 * `engine/src/url-mode.ts` applies to untrusted URL text, same reasoning, same
 * boundary). Every whitelist here is a `Set`, which is the own-property discipline
 * in its strongest available form: a `Set` has no string-keyed prototype chain to
 * confuse in the first place, so `has('constructor')` is false unless something
 * genuinely added it. Where raw objects ARE read, they are read through
 * `Object.keys`/`Object.hasOwn`, never a bare member access on an inherited name.
 *
 * DROP vs DISCONNECT. Two different failures wear the same return shape and must not
 * be treated alike by the caller. A single op that is merely *unrecognised* - an
 * input id this build does not declare, an op shape a newer peer minted - is DROPPED
 * (that op only; §11.11: never the batch, never a throw) and the session continues;
 * PWA staleness makes version skew routine (§11.19). A cap breach - depth, array
 * length, batch size, a forbidden key, a rate ceiling - is ABUSE, and §11.21 is
 * explicit that such a peer is disconnected, not silently throttled. `ABUSE_REASONS`
 * is the set the caller tests against so that decision is made from data rather than
 * from a string comparison at the call site.
 *
 * NO WALL CLOCK. `recordAndCheckRate` takes `nowMs` as a parameter and this module
 * never reads `Date.now`, `performance.now` or a `Date` - partly so the rate window
 * is deterministically testable, and partly for the §11.7 rule that an airgapped
 * device with a wrong clock behaves identically to one with a right one. A test pins
 * the absence by scanning this file's source.
 *
 * SCOPE. Pure module: no DOM, no transport, no timers, no I/O, no state beyond the
 * two rate windows. It does not decide WHAT an op means (that is collab-plumbing's
 * projection) and it does not type-check a value against its input's declared type
 * (that is `applyPatch`'s job, §11.11 - an out-of-whitelist enum or a string for a
 * number input is dropped there, per key). It decides only whether a message is
 * allowed to be looked at.
