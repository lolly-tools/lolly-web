 * rtc-handle - a connected `rtc-transport` as a `CollabSessionHandle`
 * (plan 100 section 5, section 6.2, section 6.2a, section 11.19, section 11.21; wave 2.3, Track A).
 *
 * `lib/collab-session.ts` is the composition every collab reduces to, and its header
 * names the two producers that have to reduce to it. This is Track A's - the one
 * place where "a WebRTC pair is up" becomes "a session can be mounted on it". It owns
 * the pair's LOCAL convergence document and nothing else about the network: the
 * `RTCPeerConnection`, the three lanes, ICE's vocabulary and the ceremony all stay
 * behind `rtc-transport.ts`, which this module only ever talks to through
 * {@link RtcHandleTransport} - the five-method subset a transport owes a session.
 *
 * It is deliberately the mirror of `org/collab-provider.ts` MINUS everything a server
 * implies. Both wrap `ReferenceCanvasDoc` (no yjs in the browser, ever - section 7's last
 * paragraph), both put what the LOCAL doors produce on the wire and send nothing from
 * the remote door. What is absent here is the whole point of Track A:
 *
 *   - **no outbox.** A pair has no server to be authoritative, so there is nothing to
 *     replay INTO on rejoin - a dropped connection needs a fresh ceremony (section 6.1), and
 *     the catch-up is the peer's own state, not a durable journal. Persisting ops for
 *     a session whose only other participant is a laptop on the same table would buy
 *     nothing and cost an IDB write per keystroke.
 *   - **no acks.** The gateway's "did the room accept this?" question does not exist:
 *     there is no room. Send-and-converge is the whole protocol, and what makes it
 *     safe is the backstop below rather than a receipt.
 *   - **no join handshake / role grant.** Both peers in a pair are writers by
 *     construction (section 6.2a's asymmetry is about PERSISTENCE and continuation, not about
 *     who may type). The only demotion is section 11.19's version skew, in-band, below.
 *
 * ── The divergence backstop (section 6.2, Excalidraw's pattern) ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Two peers converge by LWW while every op arrives. The ops lane is reliable and
 * ordered, so "every op arrives" is nearly always true - but nearly is not a
 * convergence proof, and there is no server holding the answer when it is not. So
 * every {@link BACKSTOP_INTERVAL_MS} milliseconds, WHEN this side has emitted
 * anything since the last exchange, the whole of our state goes out again.
 *
 * WHAT A STATE EXCHANGE IS, precisely: the op log compacted to its LWW winners - for
 * every register (`registerKeys`) the one op that currently owns it, replayed
 * VERBATIM with its original `(client, clock)` origin. That is what makes receiving
 * one a merge and not an overwrite: the receiver's document arbitrates each register
 * exactly as it would have for the live op, `beats()` is strict, so re-applying what
 * a peer already holds changes nothing (idempotent), and a register the peer holds
 * NEWER survives our restatement untouched.
 *
 * The alternative - serialising `doc.state()` and restating it under one invented
 * origin - was rejected: a snapshot carries no per-register origins, so any single
 * watermark is wrong in one direction or the other (low enough not to clobber the
 * peer's newer writes is also low enough to lose to the stale ones it exists to
 * repair), and two peers both restating under their own watermark would ping-pong a
 * contested key forever. `org/collab-protocol.ts`'s `withoutHeldKeys` documents the
 * same reasoning for the join-ack seed, which is the same problem with a server in it.
 *
 * The index costs O(registers), not O(edits) - section 11.20's "op-log unboundedness is a
 * non-issue in Track A by construction", made true rather than assumed.
 *
 * Order inside an exchange is NOT arbitrary: adds, then order keys, then field/geom/
 * param writes, then removes. The document does not care (membership is its own LWW
 * register, `ensure()` materialises a box whatever arrives first), but
 * `collab-plumbing.ts`'s model rebuild does - it refuses to resurrect a row a
 * `remove` took out and refuses to write a field on a row that does not exist yet
 * ("no resurrection"), so a batch that stated them in the other order would leave the
 * two peers' DOCUMENTS converged and their input MODELS diverged.
 *
 * ── Rate discipline: why the wire shape is a batch ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The ops-lane payload is ALWAYS an array of ops, live edits and exchanges alike - 
 * `rtc-transport`'s `d` is opaque, so one shape beats two, and one gesture is one
 * frame. It matters: section 11.21 caps a peer at ~200 ops/s and disconnects rather than
 * throttles, and `collab-plumbing.ts` mints one `OrderOp` PER ROW when a blocks array
 * is reordered - 200 rows would be 200 frames if each `apply()` wrote its own. Local
 * ops are therefore coalesced to one frame per microtask, and a state exchange is
 * PACED ({@link STATE_CHUNK_OPS} per {@link STATE_CHUNK_GAP_MS}) so a large repair
 * cannot make a healthy peer disconnect us for flooding.
 *
 * ── What arrives is untrusted, continuously (section 11.21, section 11.22) ─────────────────────
 *
 * `op-guard.ts` is the boundary, and a caller that has a mounted tool SHOULD pass one
 * (`guard`): only the guard can run the manifest whitelist, because only the caller
 * knows the tool's declared inputs. With no guard this module still refuses to apply
 * anything unchecked - the canonical ajv `validateCanvasOp` (the same compiled schema
 * lolly-work's gateway runs), a safe-integer clock, finite numbers, and the
 * `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` refusal - but that is the FLOOR, not the
 * boundary: it cannot tell a declared input id from an undeclared one.
 *
 * A cap breach disconnects the peer (section 11.21 is explicit that it is not silently
 * throttled); a merely unrecognised op is dropped and the session continues (section 11.11,
 * section 11.19 - PWA staleness makes version skew routine).
 *
 * Presence frames are rate-capped here and otherwise forwarded verbatim, because
 * `rtc-transport.parsePresenceFrame` has already checked the envelope and the roster
 * rules are `lib/collab-presence.ts`'s. `guard.checkPresence` is deliberately NOT
 * wired: it requires `cursor` and `selection`, which the engine's own `PresenceState`
 * makes optional and which every sidebar-only tool omits (section 4.1 - focus, not a cursor,
 * is the presence primitive that generalises), so wiring it here would drop every
 * real frame. That mismatch is op-guard's to resolve, not something to work around
 * with a shape sniff at this seam.
 *
 * ── No wall clock in convergence (section 11.7) ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Ordering is `(clock, client)` only. The one `now()` in this file feeds op-guard's
 * per-second RATE window, never a merge, and it is monotonic by default - an
 * airgapped device with a wrong system clock behaves identically.
 *
 * Everything time-shaped is injected ({@link RtcCollabHandleOptions.timers},
 * `now`, `schedule`), so the whole of the backstop is testable at CPU speed and
 * `close()` can be proved to leave ZERO armed timers.
