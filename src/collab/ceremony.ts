/**
 * ceremony — the private-collab pairing state machine (plan 100 §6.1, §6.2a, wave 2.2).
 *
 * PURE LOGIC. This module owns the *order of events* in a Track-A pairing and nothing
 * else: no DOM, no `RTCPeerConnection`, no codec, no timers of its own. Everything that
 * touches a platform arrives injected — the four effects (`createOffer`, `checkTool`,
 * `createAnswer`, `applyRemote`) and the two timer functions. That is what makes the
 * whole ceremony testable at fake-time speed with stub effects, which matters more here
 * than almost anywhere else in the shell: the failure modes this machine exists to model
 * (a ten-minute unanswered invite, a laptop lid closing, a guest network eating peer
 * traffic) are exactly the ones you cannot reproduce by hand.
 *
 * The dialogs (wave 2.2's UI half), the SDP mini-codec (2.1) and the RTC provider (2.3)
 * sit AROUND it: the codec turns a `CollabInvite` into the ~100-byte blob a QR carries
 * and back, the provider owns the peer connection and feeds `{ type: 'ice' }` events in,
 * the dialogs render `state.phase` and call `send()`. Signals cross this boundary as
 * DECODED envelopes on purpose — a blob that does not decode is the dialog's problem
 * ("that reply isn't readable, try again") and must not end a ceremony, so it never
 * becomes an event here.
 *
 * ── The two paths (§6.1) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   inviter:  idle → creating-invite → awaiting-answer ⇄(re-arm) → applying-answer
 *                                                                → connecting → connected
 *             connected --ICE failed--> reconnect-armed → (answer) → applying-answer → …
 *
 *   acceptor: idle → reading-invite → creating-answer → awaiting-connection → connected
 *
 * Terminal is `failed` (with a cause the UI turns into specific copy, §11.26) or
 * `closed` (the user cancelled). `reconnect-armed` is NOT terminal — it is the inviter
 * holding a freshly minted re-invite, because a dropped WebRTC connection can never be
 * resumed and always needs a fresh ceremony (§6.1); pre-minting the offer the moment the
 * old one dies is what makes the session card's "Reconnect" QR feel pre-armed.
 *
 * ── Why the acceptor probes before answering (§6.1) ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * A private collab requires the tool on BOTH devices: peers send values, never code
 * (§11.22), so the template and hooks always come from the local catalog. `checkTool`
 * answers `have` / `missing` / `version-skew`, and `missing` is an honest terminal
 * refusal at accept time rather than a join that renders nothing.
 *
 * ── The two version axes (deliberately different outcomes) ────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. TOOL version (probed): a MAJOR skew means the two catalogs disagree about what the
 *     input ids mean, so the ops would land on the wrong fields → terminal refusal
 *     (`version-major-mismatch`). A minor skew is a soft note (`toolVersionNote`), §11.19.
 *  2. OP-CONTRACT version (`CANVAS_OP_VERSION`): a major mismatch is NOT a refusal —
 *     contract §9 says the client joins OBSERVER-ONLY rather than corrupting state, so
 *     `state.observerOnly` is set and the pair still connects. Both peers set the flag on
 *     themselves, which is the symmetric, safe outcome. Either envelope MAY carry the
 *     peer's version; when the byte-starved signalling payload does not, the ops
 *     channel's hello declares it through the `peer-op-version` event instead, which
 *     still lands before the first op. Undeclared is silence, never an assumed gap.
 *
 * ── What "connected" MEANS: channels ready, never ICE connected ───────────────────
 *
 * `connected` is entered on one signal and one only: `{ type: 'ready' }`, the transport
 * reporting that the ops channel — the session-critical lane — is open on this side.
 *
 * ICE reaching `connected` is NOT that, and the difference is a shipped bug, not a
 * nicety. A data channel opens only after BOTH descriptions have been applied, which is
 * the entire ceremony completing; ICE `connected` means a candidate pair answered a
 * binding request, which on a loopback/LAN pair Chrome reports BEFORE the answer has been
 * carried back to the inviter at all (pre-answer connectivity via peer-reflexive checks).
 * Gate the phase on ICE and the acceptor is promoted out of `awaiting-connection` in the
 * same synchronous turn it entered it: step 3 never renders, the reply the inviter is
 * waiting for is never deliverable, and the inviter waits for ever. Drill evidence: the
 * answer screen's copy control never appeared, `replyLeg='none'`, inviter stuck on step 2.
 * The original trace says the same thing from the other end — `ice:connected` at 542ms,
 * both sides' channels open at 1269ms. Those 727ms are the ceremony.
 *
 * So ICE keeps every OTHER job and loses exactly one: `failed`/`closed` still ends the
 * ceremony with the isolation diagnosis, `disconnected` still raises the transient
 * `reconnecting` flag, `checking` still arms the connect watchdog — and an ICE
 * `connected` on its own now changes no phase anywhere.
 *
 * ── The publish-before-promote guarantee (§11.25) ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A promotion may never SKIP a step a human has to act on. The acceptor's answer must be
 * published and rendered before anything can move it to `connected`, and the inviter's
 * wait may not be skipped past applying a real answer. Both fall out of one rule: `ready`
 * promotes only from `connecting` (inviter, entered after `applyRemote` succeeded) and
 * `awaiting-connection` (acceptor, entered with `state.answer` already set and notified).
 * A `ready` that arrives in any earlier phase is LATCHED, not dropped and not acted on —
 * it is re-read on entering one of those two phases, after that phase has been published.
 * In practice a transport cannot report ready that early; the latch is what makes that a
 * property of this machine rather than a property of the transport being well behaved.
 *
 * ── Both surfaces are read level-triggered on entry, not only edge-triggered ───────
 *
 * The transport's events are EDGE-triggered: one notification per transition, and only
 * the phase the machine happens to be in when it lands can act on it. Two phases can only
 * ever be LEFT WELL by such an event — `awaiting-connection` (acceptor) and `connecting`
 * (inviter); every other way out of them is a deadline expiring, which is to say a
 * failure. And both are entered from inside an `await` that the transitions can, and on a
 * LAN routinely do, land during. `setLocalDescription` returns and ~5ms later ICE has
 * already gone `checking` → `connected`, while this machine is still sitting in
 * `creating-answer` (or `applying-answer`) waiting for the effect that started it. Those
 * edges arrive, match no phase that acts on them, and are dropped. Nothing looks again,
 * so a pair whose channels are open on both sides sits on the answer screen until the
 * ten-minute human deadline.
 *
 * So on ENTERING either phase the machine asks the transport what things ARE — ICE via
 * `CeremonyEffects.iceState`, the lane via `CeremonyEffects.channelsReady` — and runs
 * each answer through the same path a live event takes (`syncIce` → `onIce`, `syncReady`
 * → `onReady`). One pair of helpers, both roles, no special case: the inviter's version
 * of the race is identical in shape and merely wins by a couple of milliseconds today,
 * which is not a property worth depending on. ICE is read FIRST, so a pairing that died
 * during the mint fails rather than completing.
 *
 * `rtc-transport.ts` replaying its last emitted state to a new subscriber is the other
 * half of the guard, and the two do NOT overlap — they cover the two distinct ways these
 * signals go missing, which is why both exist:
 *
 *   - the edge was HEARD and dropped, because the phase it landed in does not act on it
 *     → the level read on entry, here (and the `ready` latch, for an effects bundle that
 *     has no level read to offer);
 *   - the edge was never heard at all, because nobody was subscribed yet → the replay,
 *     there. A machine wired up after its transport already connected (a dialog
 *     restart, the `#/join-reply` handoff) has no edge to have mistimed.
 *
 * Neither subsumes the other; together, a transition that was not acted on is always
 * re-presented, and the class stops being reachable. They are safe to stack because both
 * land on `onIce`/`onReady`, which are idempotent in the value (see `syncIce`).
 *
 * ── `disconnected` is not death (§11.3) ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ICE `disconnected` self-heals in seconds on a UDP blip, so it only raises the transient
 * `reconnecting` flag: no timer, no state change, no re-pair UI (presence greys the
 * avatar, it does not evict). Only `failed`/`closed` is fatal — and then only the inviter
 * arms a re-invite, because the inviter owns the session and is the authoritative
 * continuation (§6.2a); the acceptor's copy is ephemeral, so its drop ends in
 * `connection-lost` and its way back is scanning the inviter's fresh invite.
 *
 * No wall clock anywhere: every deadline is a delta handed to the injected timers, so a
 * device with a wrong clock (the airgap case, §11.7) behaves identically.
