/**
 * beam-ui - the door into the beam (plan 100 §6.4; the stitch-2 debt named in
 * `collab/beam-session.ts`'s header as "the caller's line").
 *
 * Five modules already implement a beam end to end - the frames (`beam-protocol.ts`),
 * the lane (`rtc-transport.ts`), staging (`lib/beam-sink.ts`), the payload
 * (`lib/beam-pack.ts`), the consent UI (`components/beam-toast.ts`) - and
 * `beam-session.ts` wires the five together. What none of them has is a way in: the
 * session is created by nobody, the toast is mounted by nobody, and `sendCurrentSession`
 * is called by nobody. A user with two paired devices could not beam a thing.
 *
 * This module is that one missing call, and deliberately nothing else. It owns no
 * frames, no storage, no protocol and no copy at all - every string a human reads
 * during a beam belongs to the toast or the pack, and the ONE new control's label
 * belongs to `components/collab-pill.ts`'s STRINGS map, which is where the translation
 * corpus can see it.
 *
 * ── The three seams it joins ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   1. **the lane.** `beam-session.ts` documents its own production wiring in one
 *      line - `createBeamSession({ lane: asBeamLane(transport.beam), inbound:
 *      beamInbound(transport) })` - and that line is here, verbatim, because this is
 *      the only module allowed to name both a transport and a beam session at once.
 *      `asBeamLane` is a compile-time no-op whose whole job is to fail `tsc` if the
 *      two shapes ever drift; keeping it means the drift proof travels with the call.
 *   2. **the library.** The default ingest needs a `BeamPackHost` - the bridge slice a
 *      pack is landed into. There is exactly one place in the shell that holds one AND
 *      knows which collab it belongs to, and it is a MOUNTED TOOL
 *      (`views/tool-collab.ts`). An ACCEPTOR holds two of them, which is the one place
 *      this module branches: their `host.state` has been swapped for the memory bridge
 *      (§11.17), so their working copy PACKS from the ephemeral one and never touches a
 *      slot - while a beam they accepted LANDS in the real library, because §6.4 says a
 *      received gift lands there attributed. `packHost` is that second host, and every
 *      caller with only one passes `host` alone and sees no branch at all.
 *   3. **the human.** `mountBeamToast(container, session.toast)` - on BOTH ends, at
 *      collab mount time, because the toast is not only the receiver's consent sheet:
 *      it is also the sender's "waiting for Priya to accept…", its progress bars and
 *      its cancel. One mount serves both directions (the session multiplexes an
 *      outgoing and an incoming beam onto one event stream), which is why there is one
 *      toast per collab and not one per beam.
 *
 * ── Consent stays where it was ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing here decides anything. The receiver's `accept`/`decline` travels back through
 * the toast port (`BeamEventSource`), exactly as `beam-session.ts` specifies, and the
 * sender's UI is the same event stream read from the other side - so the sender watches
 * its own beam through the receiver's component, with no second progress surface to
 * keep in sync and no way for this module to skip a gate it does not own.
 *
 * ── What it deliberately does NOT do ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  - **Reach for a transport.** {@link CollabBeamLink} arrives already built by whoever
 *    made the pair (`collab/rtc-connection.ts`), and is read STRUCTURALLY at the mount
 * - the `CollabHandleLanes` idiom from `views/tool-collab.ts`. A work collab (Track
 *    B) publishes none, so the send control is structurally absent there rather than
 *    hidden behind a flag: the server path has no beam and never will (§7).
 *  - **Know what a session IS.** {@link BeamCurrentSessionReader} is injected by the
 *    mounted view, because "the thing I am working on right now" is the runtime's live
 *    model and this module cannot see one.
 *  - **Own a clock or a retry.** A beam is paced by the lane's own drain callback
 *    (§11.6) and ended by the human or by the transport.
 *
 * ── The one honest limit ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A beam can only be offered and received while BOTH peers have the tool mounted,
 * because that is when each side's session subscribes to the lane. In practice that is
 * every moment a collab is live - the acceptor is navigated straight into the tool and
 * the inviter is remounted into it - but a frame that arrives in the gap between
 * `connected` and the tool's first paint is dropped rather than queued. Queuing it
 * would mean staging bytes for a consent sheet with nowhere to appear.
