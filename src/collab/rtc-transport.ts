/**
 * rtc-transport - the WebRTC half of a private collab (plan 100 §6.1, §6.2, §11.3, §11.5, §11.6).
 *
 * This is the only module in the shell that touches `RTCPeerConnection`. It
 * owns the peer connection, the three data channels, and the mapping from
 * ICE's vocabulary into the two vocabularies the rest of the feature speaks:
 * the ceremony's events (`ceremony.ts`) and a session's connection state. It
 * owns no policy: it does not decide when to re-invite, what a failure means
 * to a human, or which ops are legal.
 *
 * ── Everything platform-shaped is injected ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `opts.rtc` is the `RTCPeerConnection` constructor, defaulting to the
 * global one, and `opts.timers` is the clock. That is not a testing nicety
 * bolted on afterwards: the behaviours this module exists to get right (a
 * gathering phase that never completes because no STUN server is reachable,
 * ICE going `disconnected` for four seconds and healing, a guest network
 * where candidates gather on both sides and no pair ever forms) cannot be
 * produced on demand from a real browser. The whole suite therefore runs on
 * a scripted fake at CPU speed, and the interfaces below
 * ({@link RtcPeerConnectionLike}, {@link RtcDataChannelLike}) are the
 * minimum surface a fake has to implement. The real DOM classes satisfy
 * them structurally, and `defaultPeerConnectionCtor()` is where that is
 * *typechecked* rather than assumed: no cast, so a DOM-lib change that
 * broke the subset would fail `tsc`, not production.
 *
 * ── Non-trickle gathering is the whole point of the ceremony (§6.1) ───────────────
 *
 * The humans are the signalling channel: A shows one blob, B shows one
 * back. That only works if every candidate is already inside the blob, so
 * `createOffer`/`createAnswer` set the local description and then WAIT for
 * gathering to finish before extracting. The wait is bounded
 * ({@link GATHER_TIMEOUT_MS}) and, on expiry, proceeds with what it has
 * instead of failing. On a LAN the host candidates arrive in milliseconds
 * and the only thing still outstanding is a STUN reflexive lookup that is
 * never coming back, exactly the airgapped case this feature is for. A blob
 * with the host candidates in it pairs; a ceremony that timed out waiting
 * for the internet does not.
 *
 * ── `disconnected` is not death (§11.3) ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ICE `disconnected` self-heals in seconds on a UDP blip. It moves this
 * module's connection state to `'reconnecting'` and nothing else: no
 * teardown, no re-pair, no eviction. Only `failed`/`closed` is fatal, and
 * the ceremony decides what that means (the inviter arms a fresh invite,
 * the acceptor ends in `connection-lost`). Conflating the two is the single
 * most expensive mistake available here: it would show a re-pair dialog
 * every time a Wi-Fi packet went missing.
 *
 * Both `connectionstatechange` and `iceconnectionstatechange` are watched
 * and mapped into the ceremony's alphabet, deduped by last-emitted value.
 * Two sources rather than one because `connectionState` is the better
 * signal (it folds DTLS in) and `iceConnectionState` is the more
 * universally implemented; a browser that reports only one still drives
 * the ceremony correctly.
 *
 * ── ICE-connected is NOT session-usable: `{ type: 'ready' }` is (§6.2) ───────────
 *
 * The one signal that means "this pair can carry a session" is the ops
 * channel being OPEN on this side. Data channels only open once BOTH
 * descriptions have been applied, which is the whole ceremony completing;
 * ICE reaching `connected` means only that some candidate pair answered a
 * binding request, and on a loopback/LAN pair Chrome reports exactly that
 * BEFORE the answer has been carried back to the inviter (pre-answer
 * connectivity from peer-reflexive checks). The measured trace says the
 * same thing from the other end: `ice:connected` at 542ms, channels open
 * on both sides at 1269ms.
 *
 * So this module sources a first-class `{ type: 'ready' }` alongside the
 * ICE stream, and `ceremony.ts` gates its `connected` phase on that and
 * nothing else. ICE keeps every other job it had (failure diagnosis, the
 * transient `disconnected` flag, arming the connect watchdog), and an ICE
 * `connected` on its own moves no phase anywhere.
 *
 * `ready` is emitted ONCE per peer connection (the ops channel cannot
 * re-open) and reset by {@link newPeerConnection} exactly like
 * `lastEmittedIce`, so a re-invite never inherits the previous pairing's
 * completion.
 *
 * ── The ceremony surface is STATE, so it replays on subscribe ────────────────────
 *
 * `{ type: 'ice' }`, `{ type: 'ready' }` and `{ type: 'peer-op-version' }`
 * are not notifications of things that happened, they are the current
 * value of something, and a subscriber that arrives after the last
 * transition would otherwise never learn it. On a LAN that is the normal
 * case, not an edge one: ICE reaches `connected` within about five
 * milliseconds of `setLocalDescription`, well inside the awaits the
 * ceremony mints its answer in, and on the `#/join-reply` handoff the
 * channels can be open before the machine that cares exists at all.
 *
 * {@link RtcTransport.onCeremonyEvent} therefore delivers the last EMITTED
 * ICE state, the ops lane's readiness, and the peer's last declared op
 * version, to the new subscriber immediately and to it alone, in that
 * order, because that is the order they happen in and because a replayed
 * failure must beat a replayed completion.
 *
 * This is the half of the guard that covers an edge NOBODY HEARD: a
 * machine wired up after its transport already connected, which is what a
 * dialog restart or the `#/join-reply` handoff produces. The other half
 * lives in `ceremony.ts`: an edge that WAS heard and dropped, because the
 * phase it landed in had no ICE exit. Neither subsumes the other, and the
 * ceremony's header spells the pair out. Two properties make them safe to
 * stack, so belt and braces never double-fires a transition:
 *
 *  - the live stream is deduped on `lastEmittedIce` (and `readyEmitted`), so
 *    a value that was just replayed can never be emitted again without
 *    changing first: replay and live are disjoint;
 *  - every consumer of these three events is idempotent in the value.
 *    `onIce('connected')` while connected is a no-op, a second `ready`
 *    while connected is a no-op, and a repeated op-version recomputes the
 *    same flag.
 *
 * `lastEmittedIce` and `readyEmitted` reset with each new peer connection,
 * so a re-invite replays nothing from the pairing it replaced. A closed
 * transport replays nothing at all.
 *
 * The whole-state `'state'` event is left edge-only on purpose: it already
 * publishes a complete snapshot and pairs with {@link RtcTransport.state}
 * as its level read, so a subscriber has somewhere to ask. The ceremony
 * surface had neither, which is the bug.
 *
 * ── The plate material: both fingerprints, exactly as they were used ────────────
 *
 * The connection plate (`plate.ts`) is the pairing's short authentication
 * string, and it is only worth anything if it is derived from the
 * fingerprints the DTLS handshake actually validated against. This module
 * is the only place that holds both: {@link RtcCeremonyEffects.plateMaterial}
 * publishes the one `extract()` pulled out of our OWN local description
 * before minting a blob, and the one `decodePayload()` read out of the
 * peer's blob, the byte-for-byte fingerprint `reconstruct()` put into the
 * remote description. A plate derived from a re-read, a cache or a display
 * string would be a number that agrees with itself and proves nothing.
 *
 * Two latches, reset by {@link newPeerConnection} exactly like
 * `readyEmitted` and `lastEmittedIce`: a re-invite is a new pairing with a
 * new certificate on at least one side, and inheriting the spent pairing's
 * fingerprint would show two humans a plate for a connection that no
 * longer exists. `null` until BOTH are known (and after `close()`),
 * because half a pair derives nothing: the caller shows nothing rather
 * than a wrong plate. Copies go out, not the arrays themselves: this is a
 * diagnostic read, and the pairing's trust root is not something to hand
 * out a mutable handle to.
 *
 * ── The isolation heuristic (§11.1, §11.2, §11.26) ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * "It didn't connect" is a support ticket; "this network blocks
 * device-to-device traffic" is a shrug and a hotspot. The difference is
 * knowable: Wi-Fi client isolation and blocked mDNS both look like
 * *candidates gathered on both sides, and no candidate pair ever formed*.
 * {@link RtcTransportState.diagnosis} reports that, alongside the two
 * neighbouring diagnoses it must not be confused with (we gathered nothing
 * at all; the peer's blob carried nothing), and `isolationSuspected` is
 * the boolean the failure copy keys off. A pair is observed either by ICE
 * reaching `connected`/`completed` or by a `getStats()` sample containing
 * a `candidate-pair` report; the second path is what catches the case
 * where a pair formed and DTLS then failed, a different story from
 * isolation that must not borrow its copy.
 *
 * ── Three channels, three jobs (§6.2, §11.6) ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   ops       ordered + reliable      the convergence lane; also carries the hello
 *   presence  unordered, 0 retransmits  cursors/focus; stale frames are expected (§11.5)
 *   beam      ordered + reliable      bulk transfer, on its OWN channel (§11.6)
 *
 * Beam gets its own channel because a 38 MB pack sharing the ops channel
 * would queue every edit behind it: head-of-line blocking that would make
 * co-editing feel broken for the whole duration of a transfer. Every frame
 * is capped at {@link MAX_FRAME_BYTES} (§11.6's cross-browser SCTP
 * ceiling): oversize is refused as a typed result, never sent and never
 * allowed to kill the channel.
 *
 * Presence frames carry the sender's own `from`/`seq` when they already
 * have them: `PresenceEngine.snapshot()` relays OTHER peers' frames
 * verbatim, so re-stamping would corrupt the join handshake. Only an
 * unstamped frame gets this client's id and the next sequence number
 * (§11.5, the receiver applies newest-only).
 *
 * ── Integration points, deliberately not imported ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * {@link RtcBeamLane} is structurally a `BeamWire` from `beam-protocol.ts`
 * (`json` + `binary`), and `onDrain()` is where that module's
 * `createBeamSender().nextChunk()` belongs: pull until `bufferedAmount()`
 * reaches `lowThreshold`, then let the `bufferedamountlow` event pull
 * again. The import is left out on purpose: a transport that hard-depends
 * on the beam protocol cannot be used by a session that never beams.
 *
 * Likewise the session adapter. `lib/collab-session.ts` defines a
 * `CollabSessionHandle` with `presenceIn`/`sendPresence`/`events`/`close`;
 * {@link RtcTransportState.connection} already uses that module's exact
 * `'connecting' | 'live' | 'reconnecting' | 'closed'` alphabet so the
 * adapter is a shape change and not a translation. TODO (stitch pass):
 * write `toCollabSessionHandle(transport, adapter, self)` in the wiring
 * layer, where both modules may legitimately be imported at once. It is
 * not written here because a transport must not depend on a session, and
 * `collab-session.ts` is still moving.
 *
 * ── What this deliberately does NOT do ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Stated so nobody assumes it is handled here and nobody implements it twice:
 *
 *  - **Op validation.** Inbound ops are shape-checked as an envelope and
 *    handed on verbatim. `validateCanvasOp` + the manifest's own-property
 *    whitelist (§11.21) run where the tool's input model is in scope, not here.
 *  - **Rate caps.** §11.21 wants ~200 ops/s and ~40 presence/s, with a peer
 *    that exceeds them disconnected rather than silently throttled. The
 *    counters belong with the policy that acts on them (the session layer
 *    holds the roster and the disconnect); what this module owns is the
 *    per-frame size cap, which is a wire property.
 *  - **Reconnect policy.** It reports the states; `ceremony.ts` decides
 *    what a drop means, and only the inviter arms a fresh invite (§6.2a).
 *  - **The presence roster.** Frames pass through unreordered and
 *    unmerged; newest-only is `lib/collab-presence.ts`'s rule (§11.5).
 *
 * No wall clock anywhere: every deadline is a delta handed to the injected
 * timers, so a device with a wrong clock (the airgap case, §11.7) behaves
 * identically.
