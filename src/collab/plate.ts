 * plate — the connection plate, a private collab's short authentication string
 * (plan 100 §1, §6.1; Andy's decision, 2026-08-10).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. Plan 100 §1 floated a license-plate code as a third
 * SKIN — six spoken characters standing in for the invite blob, redeemed against a tiny
 * rendezvous. Andy's call reverses the direction: the plate is the CONFIRMATION, never a
 * carrier. It carries no material, needs no rendezvous, and is derived from the pairing
 * that already exists. The link and the QR stay the only things that move SDP, so the
 * "codes need a server" trade in §1 does not apply to this at all — an airgapped pair
 * gets a plate exactly like everyone else.
 *
 * It is the ZRTP-style SAS (RFC 6189 §7), doing the one job a fingerprint-carrying blob
 * cannot do on its own: proving the blob was not swapped in flight. Both screens show six
 * characters at the moment they connect; the humans compare them out loud. Matching
 * plates mean both devices hashed the SAME PAIR of DTLS certificate fingerprints, which
 * they can only do if each one is holding the other's real certificate. A middleman has
 * to terminate DTLS on both sides — two certificates of its own, which is two
 * fingerprints neither human's device ever saw — and no substitution it can make in the
 * invite or the reply produces two matching plates. It cannot compute a plate for a pair
 * of fingerprints it is not, itself, one half of.
 *
 * THE MATERIAL IS THE THING THE HANDSHAKE ACTUALLY VALIDATED. `rtc-transport.ts` hands
 * over the fingerprint it extracted from its OWN local description and the one it decoded
 * from the peer's blob — the same bytes it reconstructed the remote SDP from, so the same
 * bytes DTLS checked the certificate against. A plate derived from anything else (a
 * re-read of the SDP text, a fingerprint the UI cached) would be a number that agrees with
 * itself and proves nothing.
 *
 * ── The alphabet: 29 characters, and each exclusion has a reason ──────────────────
 *
 * `23456789ACDEFGHJKMNPQRSTVWXYZ`. Crockford base32 already drops I, L, O and U — I and L
 * against the digit 1, O against 0, U so a code cannot spell an accident. Three more go,
 * because this code is SPOKEN and typed from hearing rather than scanned:
 *
 *  - **0 and 1.** Crockford's answer to O/0 and I/L/1 is a tolerant DECODER: it accepts
 *    the letters and folds them onto the digits. A plate has no decoder. The comparator
 *    is two people on a phone, and "oh" against "zero" is precisely the ambiguity the
 *    comparison must not absorb — the one moment the two strings differ is the moment the
 *    whole mechanism exists for.
 *  - **B.** 8 stays (the digits earn their place: an all-letter plate reads as a word,
 *    and a word gets remembered and half-recalled instead of compared character by
 *    character), and B against 8 is the last pair in Crockford's set that a condensed
 *    face still blurs.
 *
 * What that leaves is 29 symbols, which is deliberately NOT a power of two — see
 * {@link derivePlate} for why the draw is rejection-sampled rather than reduced.
 *
 * Six characters is 29^6 ≈ 5.9 × 10^8, a shade over 29 bits. ZRTP's own SAS is 2^16 over
 * four base32 characters; this is ~8000× that, and an attacker gets exactly one attempt —
 * the plate is compared once, at connect, over a DTLS session whose keys are already
 * fixed. There is no oracle to grind against and nothing to retry.
 *
 * ── Async, with the hasher injected ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Web Crypto's digest is async, so this is async, and the hasher arrives the way
 * `beam-protocol.ts`'s does: a default that reaches for `crypto.subtle` and throws a
 * named error when there is none, overridable by the caller. That seam is what lets the
 * suite pin the rejection sampling and the block-extension path against a scripted
 * digest, which no fixture over the real SHA-256 could reach.
 *
 * Pure: no DOM, no clock, no storage, no RTC. It takes two byte arrays and returns a
 * string, which is why the ceremony dialog may import it without importing a transport.

 * the counter mints another block rather than reaching for a biased shortcut. Every path
 * is deterministic: the same two fingerprints always produce the same plate.
 *
