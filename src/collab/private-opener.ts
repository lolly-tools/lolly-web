/**
 * private-opener - the `'private'` slot of `lib/collab-launch.ts`: what actually happens
 * when someone presses "Start a collab" in the Share dialog (plan 100 §0, §6.1, §11.25;
 * wave 2.4).
 *
 * `lib/collab-share-private.ts` renders that row, and has been gated on TWO things since
 * it landed: the `private-collab` flag, and an opener existing at all. Nothing registered
 * one, so the row has never rendered. This file registers it - as a side effect of being
 * imported, exactly like the share row itself, with `main.ts` importing it for that one
 * effect.
 *
 * ── Why this module holds no platform ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is on the BOOT path, and what it opens is not: a peer connection, a QR encoder, a
 * ceremony dialog and the codec are ~all of `collab/` (plus the ceremony component). Most
 * loads of the app never start a collab - that was true when the flag was default-OFF and
 * is still true now that it is default-ON (2026-08-10), because the flag decides whether
 * the ROW exists, not whether anyone presses it. So the heavy half is behind one `await
 * import('./join-route.ts')` inside the opener - the same chunk `#/join` loads, which is
 * the right pairing anyway: the two sides of one ceremony share every platform piece.
 *
 * The static imports here are the two gates and the registry, nothing else.
 *
 * ── The flag is checked INSIDE the opener, not around the registration ─────────
 *
 * Registering unconditionally and gating inside is what makes the flag live: a user who
 * turns it on in their profile gets a working row without a reload, and one who turns it
 * off gets a row that stops opening anything. (`lib/collab-share-private.ts` reads the
 * flag on every dialog open for the same reason, so the row disappears in step with it.)
 * The cost of an inert registration is one closure.
 *
 * ── What happens on connect ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The live pair goes to `lib/collab-mount.ts` - the single-provider seam the co-editing
 * stitch registers into (`lib/collab-live-mount.ts`, installed from `main.ts`'s boot).
 * With nothing registered the connection is PARKED and the dialog gains one honest
 * sentence. Not a crash, not a silent success: `main.ts` installs a mount on every boot,
 * so the only person who ever sees that sentence is a developer running without it, and
 * they are owed the truth rather than a dialog that pretends.
 *
 * ── The seed (§6.1, §12 Q3: transfer-on-connect, one path) ─────────────────────
 *
 * The inviter serialises its live model ONCE, here, at ceremony start - and it does not
 * have to build that serialisation, because `CollabLaunchContext.baseParts` already IS
 * it: the Share dialog's own `buildShareParams(runtime)` output, the URL-mode encoding of
 * every declared input. `lib/collab-live-mount.ts`'s header explains why URL params are
 * the seed's currency rather than raw values (they are what `parseUrlState` types against
 * the manifest, which is also §6.3's validation rule for a peer's payload).
 *
 * That one value is spent twice, in the two directions it has to travel:
 *
 *   - OUT, as the transport's in-band hello seed, so the acceptor's tool opens already
 *     populated instead of waiting for convergence to fill it in;
 *   - BACK, on {@link CollabConnection.seed}, so the inviter's own forced remount is born
 *     with the same model and unsaved edits survive becoming a collab.
 *
 * The outbound copy is PACKED when the engine can (`z=`, the same compression the address
 * bar uses above ~1800 chars) - the hello has a 64 KB frame ceiling and drops an
 * over-sized seed rather than lose the op-version declaration beside it. The local copy
 * stays readable, because the remount merges it with the address bar and two packed
 * blobs cannot be merged.
 *
 * ── The reply leg ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * §11.25 calls the answer leg the ceremony's weak point and makes the reply a link too.
 * That link opens `#/join-reply` in a NEW tab, which posts the payload over a
 * `BroadcastChannel`; the listener wired here for the life of the dialog is the other end
 * of it. It drives the dialog's own paste path, so a reply that arrives this way is
 * validated, noticed and displayed exactly like one a human pasted.
