/**
 * link-base - every production call site that opens the ceremony dialog must pass
 * an explicit `linkBase` (plan 100 §6.1, §11.25; the pre-stitch concerns pass,
 * 2026-08-09).
 *
 * `components/collab-ceremony.ts` is i18n-owned right now, so the trap it carries
 * cannot be fixed at its source in this pass: `buildInvite`/`buildAnswer` fall back
 * to `defaultLinkBase()` - `location.origin + location.pathname` - whenever a caller
 * omits `linkBase`. That default is exactly wrong from a tool page: production
 * serves a crawler stub at the tool view's own `/t/<id>` pathname whose inline
 * redirect does `location.replace('/#/tool/<id>' + location.search)`, which DROPS
 * the fragment - so an invite or reply link minted with no explicit `linkBase` from
 * that context would silently point the other device at something else, with
 * nothing on screen to explain why (`collab/join-route.ts`'s `appLinkBase()` spells
 * the same trap out, and is the fix both shipping callers already apply).
 *
 * Both shipping callers - `collab/join-route.ts`'s `mountJoinRoute` (via
 * `deps.linkBase ?? appLinkBase()`) and `collab/private-opener.ts`'s
 * `openPrivateCollab` (via `deps.linkBase ?? wiring?.appLinkBase()`) - already pass
 * `linkBase` today. This test is not about them; it is about the NEXT caller, who
 * will not have read this comment and will not know the component's own default is
 * a trap rather than a convenience. Since the component itself is off-limits (and
 * even a fix there would only change the DEFAULT, not force a future caller to
 * think about it), this scans the other direction: every production `.ts` file
 * that reaches `openCollabCeremony` - by direct import, or through a dynamic
 * `import()`'s namespace object the way `private-opener.ts` does - must ALSO write
 * `linkBase:` somewhere in that same file. No allowlist: a new caller that omits it
 * fails this test in CI, rather than shipping a link that quietly opens the wrong
 * page for a stranger who has no way to know it happened.
 *
 * SCOPE, STATED HONESTLY. This is a per-FILE scan, not a per-call-site one - it
 * cannot see whether the `linkBase:` a file contains is the one actually reaching
 * the SAME call that opens the ceremony (a file could, in principle, declare a
 * `linkBase?` field it never forwards). That is the trade a grep-based guard makes
 * everywhere else in this codebase (see `primitive-guards.test.ts`'s own note on
 * ratchets over content rules): a false negative here is a file that half-wires the
 * option, which is a smaller, more visible bug than the one this guard exists to
 * catch - a caller that never thought about `linkBase` at all.
 *
 * `*.test.ts` files are excluded on purpose: several of
 * `components/collab-ceremony.test.ts`'s own cases open the dialog with NO
 * `linkBase`, deliberately, to exercise `defaultLinkBase()` itself - that is a unit
 * test of the fallback, not a production caller inheriting it by accident. Comments
 * are stripped before matching, so `collab/qr-skin.ts`'s doc-comment usage example
 * (which demonstrates `scan`/`onClose` wiring, not the link plumbing, and omits
 * `linkBase` because it is not that example's point) does not trip this - the
 * identifier appears only inside a `/** … *\/` block, which the strip removes
 * before the scan ever runs.
 *
 * Run directly:  node --test shells/web/src/collab/link-base.test.ts
