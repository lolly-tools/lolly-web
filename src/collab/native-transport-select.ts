 * native-transport-select - which transport carries a private collab (plans/110 §4).
 *
 * A pure decision, no I/O and no crypto: given the local platform, whether WebRTC even
 * exists here, the user's preference, and (when accepting) the invite's declared kind,
 * choose `'rtc'` (WebRTC data channels, the default and the only cross-shell option),
 * `'native'` (the Noise-over-TCP LAN transport of plans/110 §4, Tauri↔Tauri only), or
 * `'none'` (no viable transport - an honest refusal, e.g. WebRTC-absent Linux with no
 * native invite to accept).
 *
 * This is the design-stable seam of N2: it does not depend on how the Noise handshake,
 * the frame grammar, or the sdp-codec wire variant are finally shaped (those are under
 * security review, see `plans/110-work/n2-design.md`). It is implemented and tested now
 * as the contract N2b's real transport construction will consult; it is deliberately
 * NOT yet wired into the ceremony/transport build.
 *
 * TWO PEERS NEVER GUESS. When accepting, the invite's `inviteKind` is the agreement - 
 * a native invite is accepted natively or not at all, a webrtc invite over WebRTC or not
 * at all. Only when MINTING a fresh invite (no `inviteKind`) does preference + platform
 * decide.
 *
 * NATIVE IS NEARBY-ONLY (security decision, 2026-08-13). The native transport connects a
 * socket, and the socket-open is restricted to a peer found by nearby discovery (an
 * address that came from an mDNS advert, not an attacker-authored token) and further to a
 * private/link-local range (plans/110 §5). So a native invite can ONLY be MINTED for a
 * nearby pairing (`origin: 'nearby'`); a QR/link pairing (`origin: 'link'`) never yields
 * native, whatever the preference - it uses WebRTC, or refuses when WebRTC is absent.
 * A received `native` invite is by construction nearby-originated (only the nearby
 * invite-exchange frames carry the native kind - there is no native token in the QR codec),
 * so accepting needs no `origin`. Consequence, stated: a Linux/webkitgtk device with no
 * WebRTC can pair via nearby but NOT via a pasted QR link (that link has no viable
 * transport) - the safe trade, and nearby is where those devices are.
