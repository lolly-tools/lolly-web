/**
 * rtc-connection — Track A's producer for `lib/collab-mount.ts`'s transport-agnostic
 * seam: a connected ceremony becomes a `CollabConnection` (plan 100 §5, §6.1, §6.2a,
 * §12 Q3; wave 2.5).
 *
 * The seam used to carry an `RtcTransport` and the ceremony's dialog handle, which made
 * it Track A's shape wearing a generic name — an org room has neither. It now carries a
 * built {@link CollabSessionHandle} and a `close()`, so this file is where "a WebRTC pair
 * is up" turns into that, and `org/collab-handle.ts` is where a work room does. Neither
 * mount knows which one it got.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ITS OWN MODULE, and not two lines inside the ceremony wiring: it is the only
 * place outside a mounted tool that pulls `collab/rtc-handle.ts` (and through it
 * `ReferenceCanvasDoc` + the op guard). `collab/private-opener.ts` sits on the BOOT path
 * — it registers the Share-dialog opener as an import side effect — so a static import
 * of the convergence stack there would be downloaded and parsed on every load of the app,
 * for a ceremony almost none of those loads will start (true whichever way the
 * `private-collab` flag defaults; it is ON as of 2026-08-10). Living here, it rides the
 * same lazily-imported ceremony chunk as `join-route.ts`, which is the code that needs it.
 *
 * ── The seed latch (§6.1, §12 Q3) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The acceptor's session state arrives IN BAND, on the ops-lane hello — never in the
 * invite blob, which is sized for a QR (§6.1). But the ceremony reaches `connected` off
 * an ICE event, and ICE connects before the SCTP data channel the hello rides on. So the
 * connection is handed to the mount BEFORE its seed exists, every time.
 *
 * Rather than have the mount guess, the latch is armed HERE — at hand-off, the earliest
 * moment a caller holds the transport and the last moment before the mount would want to
 * read it — and published as {@link CollabConnection.seedLater}. `rtc-handle.ts`
 * deliberately ignores `hello.seed` ("a caller that wants it subscribes to
 * `transport.on('message')` itself", and it is untrusted URL text either way), which is
 * exactly the door this uses.
 *
 * A seed that never lands is NOT an error and the promise still resolves (with
 * `undefined`) once the deadline passes: §6.2's late joiner gets the full state from the
 * peer through ordinary convergence, so the seed only ever buys a faster, already-
 * populated first paint.
 *
 * ── The beam link (§6.4) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The paired channel is a general encrypted conduit; co-editing is one payload type on
 * it, and the bulk lane is another (`collab/beam-ui.ts`). The transport is the only
 * thing that holds that lane, and this is the only module that holds the transport, so
 * the connection carries it on as `beam` — the mount cannot re-derive it, exactly like
 * every other field on {@link CollabConnection}.
 *
 * It is an ADDITIVE mixin on the return type rather than a field of the seam's own
 * interface, and that is the point: `lib/collab-mount.ts` is transport-agnostic, an org
 * room has no beam and never will (§7 — the server path carries ops and presence), so
 * the mount reads it structurally and a work collab simply answers "none". The send
 * control is then absent on Track B by construction, not by a flag someone has to
 * remember to check.
