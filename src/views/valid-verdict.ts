// ── Change-history source-type wording ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// A step's IPTC `digitalSourceType` says what the material at that step IS. For
// a producing action (created/resized/edited/converted) that is the step's own
// output, so "Generated by AI" reads correctly. For an INGEST action (opened /
// placed) it describes what the step took IN — and Lolly's `c2pa.opened`
// deliberately propagates an ingredient's AI source type onto its own manifest
// so the flag survives even if the ingredient manifests are stripped
// (engine/src/c2pa.ts). Rendered with the producing wording, that propagated
// claim sat under the green Lolly pill reading "Generated by AI", which says
// Lolly generated the pixels. It did not — it opened something that already
// was. Same claim, attributed to the step that actually makes it.
