/**
 * A team-session origin never outlives the mount that consumed it - INCLUDING the
 * mounts that never happen (plan 100 §7; `org/team-session-origin.ts` rule 3).
 *
 * `org/team-session-origin.test.ts` proves the module: one-shot arming, a mismatch that
 * clears both states, and a release that drops the live one. What it cannot prove is the
 * half that decides whether any of that holds in the product - THE VIEW WIRING - because
 * `mountTool` imports stylesheets and reaches modules that resolve siblings with `.js`
 * specifiers, so no suite outside Vite can mount it (the reason `views/tool-collab-mount.
 * test.ts` and `views/block-row-id.test.ts` scan rather than mount).
 *
 * The gap this file closes was real. `consumeTeamSessionOrigin` does not merely SPEND the
 * stash: on a tool-id match it PROMOTES it to the module's live slot, and the view's only
 * release sits inside the `viewEl._cleanup` closure that is not assigned until the mount
 * is fully built, ~1500 lines later. Every abandoned mount in between - a 404, an offline
 * load, a validation failure, a capability this shell cannot fulfil - therefore left an
 * origin live with nothing to release it (`main.ts`'s `navigate()` calls
 * `view._cleanup?.()`, and this view had given it none). The concrete cost, on a governed
 * instance: open a team session of a `capture` tool on Safari, get the "desktop only"
 * card, go to Projects, share a LOCAL session of the same tool - and `org/collab-share.ts`
 * reads the stale team `sessionId` at press time and keys a work collab on somebody
 * else's session. An id that is present and wrong is precisely what that module exists to
 * prevent, and it can only be prevented here.
 *
 * So this suite pins both halves:
 *
 *  1. THE TEXT. Every `return` between the consume and the `_cleanup` assignment releases
 *     first. Nested function bodies are stripped before the scan, so the invariant covers
 *     the WHOLE danger zone rather than the five branches that exist today - a sixth
 *     early return added tomorrow fails this test rather than shipping the bug back.
 *  2. THE BEHAVIOUR. The module, driven through the same sequence the view performs, ends
 *     with nothing readable - proof that the calls added to the view are the ones that
 *     actually close the hole.
 *
 * Run directly:  node --test shells/web/src/views/tool-team-origin.test.ts
