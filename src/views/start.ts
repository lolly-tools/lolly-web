/**
 * #/start - the Design System studio (plan 97). This is THE place the design
 * system is set, saved, edited and deleted; the Dashboard's Design-system tab
 * renders the result read-only, and user preferences (theme, sound) live on
 * Profile. Five of the six rooms are lib/brand-editor.ts's panels, mounted once
 * with everything wired; this view owns what sits around them:
 *
 *   - the RAIL of rooms (Overview · Colours · Type · Logos · Tokens · Files) - 
 *     independent areas, not steps: nothing is numbered, nothing gates on
 *     anything else, and arriving anywhere is legitimate. The editor renders
 *     all five of its panels and this view flips `data-active-tab` on it, so
 *     changing room never re-mounts anything. `overview` is not one of the
 *     editor's panels - parking that key on the same attribute hides all five,
 *     which is exactly what the Overview room wants. On a phone the rail
 *     becomes a horizontal chip strip pinned under the header;
 *   - the RAIL FOOT: "Add from…" (the source picker - a design file: a
 *     W3C/Tokens-Studio JSON, a Penpot file, an SVG's colours or a Lolly brand
 *     file; a PDF, read here for its colours, marks and embedded faces; an image;
 *     a font file), Export, and Versions (plan 97 section 6a - publish, activate,
 *     restore; hidden until the studio has something of its own to publish, and
 *     mounted the first time it is opened). All three act on the whole design
 *     system rather than the open room, which is why they sit in the chrome and
 *     not in a room;
 *   - the OVERVIEW room itself (lib/design-system/rooms/overview.ts) - the hub
 *     and the completion state. There is no finish card: Overview is always
 *     reachable and always reflects exactly what exists.
 *
 * Everything persists to the one `user/tokens/brand` install via the bridge's
 * single write chokepoint (installUserTokens → bust); a source install takes a
 * checkpoint first (lib/design-system/studio-state.ts), so "revert to before
 * the import" is one restore rather than a lost afternoon. A LOCKED catalog
 * owns its brand and can't be adjusted, so the route degrades to a read-only
 * note. Esc or the back pill returns to the view the user came from - the pill
 * wears that view's name (lib/back-nav.ts), falling back to "Tools" (the
 * gallery) when there's no history. `?area=<key>` deep-links a room (`?tab=` is
 * its kept alias - see lib/design-system/start-route.ts for the whole table).
