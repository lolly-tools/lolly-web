/**
 * THE TEMPLATE CHOOSER IS NOT IN THE MOUNT PATH.
 *
 * A tool that ships `templates/` (today: Design, four of them) used to open like
 * this: `views/tool.ts` awaited `openTemplateChooser`, and `createRuntime` - the whole
 * mount - could not begin until a human clicked a tile. In that same window the chooser
 * eagerly rendered a live preview per template, each one a real off-screen tool mount +
 * walker export. Measured on a cache-cold first open: ~1 s per template, 3972 / 3999 /
 * 4355 ms for the four, main-thread, before the editor had drawn a single pixel. Layout
 * Studio and Sequence Studio are within noise of each other at every engine phase; this
 * was the difference a user could feel.
 *
 * The fix is structural, so the guard is structural: the chooser is STARTED where it
 * always was (the modal appears just as early) but never awaited, and the pick lands
 * afterwards as an `applyPatch` seed on the already-mounted runtime. Three properties
 * have to hold together, and any one of them regressing silently restores the stall:
 *
 *   1. nothing awaits the chooser before `createRuntime`;
 *   2. the chooser is still started BEFORE it, or the modal arrives late instead;
 *   3. the pick is applied through `applyPatch`, not `setInput` - `setInput` is
 *      mountTool's undo-history wrapper (and collab's op wrapper), so seeding through it
 *      would make ⌘Z erase the template the user just chose.
 *
 * WHY A SOURCE SCAN: `mountTool` cannot be imported outside Vite - it imports
 * stylesheets and reaches `tool-inputs.ts`, whose sibling imports use the `.js` specifier
 * convention Node cannot resolve. `views/tool-collab-mount.test.ts`, `views/block-row-id
 * .test.ts` and `views/multi-edit-crash-guard.test.ts` all scan for the same reason; this
 * file follows them. The chooser's own runtime behaviour is covered by
 * `views/template-chooser.test.ts`.
 *
 * Run directly:  node --test shells/web/src/views/tool-template-mount.test.ts
