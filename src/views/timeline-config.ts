 * put a reachable value on the other side of an invariant the plan path depends on.
 * `buildPlan`'s depth sort is by resolved `z`, and that reproduces a perspective render
 * only while `κ = cos(rx)·cos(ry) > 0` - past a quarter turn the sign flips, the far
 * layer becomes the one painted last, and a "lifted" layer SHRINKS. At `rx = −120`
 * three layers at z 0/100/200 come out fully opaque, view-axis depths 1200/1250/1300,

 * ±25°, Depthfield's own −38°). Past ~75° a screen-parallel plane is nearly edge-on
 * and there is no artwork left to look at, so nothing is being withheld.

 * simply not something the UI will author), exactly as `z`'s wire stays ±12000 while

 * The camera moves that write keyframes (plans/104 section 8, section 12 Q8) - stored EXPANDED.
 *
 * Each `track` is the plan's own literal wire sketch, parsed by the ENGINE's `parseKf`
 * on the way in and re-serialised on the way out, so a preset is indistinguishable from
 * a hand-authored move the moment it is applied: no preset name is stored anywhere, nothing
 * downstream has to resolve one, and every key is editable, retimeable and deletable
 * like any other (plan 101's rule, which this plan inherits).
 *
 * The first five exercise v1 channels only. **Surface glide and Orbit are P2's** and
 * are the first two that author `rx`/`ry`; both obey THE RESOLUTION RULE (Andy,
 * 2026-08-12, binding on every generated animation): *"elements lift off and rest back
 * down on the page; the animations showing them falling apart need to close out with it
 * all coming together."* Their last keyframe IS the rest pose - every channel the track
 * touches returns to its default - so the move is a departure that comes home rather
 * than a shot that ends stranded at an angle. `tests/keyframes-tilt.test.ts` asserts it
 * by evaluating each tilt track at its own end.
 *
 * ⚑ MEASURED, NOT FIXED HERE: the five P1 presets above predate that rule and do NOT
 * obey it - `push-in` ends at `z −220`, `pull-back` at `z 0` (it does), `pan-across` at
 * `x 140`, `rise` at `y −120, z −80`, `reveal` at rest. Bringing `push-in`, `pan-across`
 * and `rise` home would change what three shipped moves MEAN (a push-in that pushes back
 * out is a different shot), which is a product call and not a P2 one. Flagged for Andy
 * with the numbers rather than changed in passing.
 *
 * ⚑ THE DOLLY SIGN IS INVERTED FROM section 8's SKETCHES, and deliberately. The engine's own
 * projection is `eff = P / (P − (z − camZ))` (`projectDepth`), so a camera whose `z`
 * GROWS is a camera moving AWAY: a layer at z = 0 under camZ = 220 renders at
 * eff = 1200/1420 = 0.845, i.e. smaller. section 8's sketch for "Push in" ends at z 220 and
 * would therefore pull back, and "Pull back" would push in - the two sketches are each
 * other's. section 4.3's own Vertigo derivation agrees with the formula and not with the
 * sketches (`camZ = P·(1/c − 1) + z_s` puts camZ BELOW the subject plane to magnify
 * it, and names camZ ≈ −600 for the recipe), so the sketch is what is wrong here. The
 * FORM of every preset is kept exactly as authored - the same instants, the same
 * eases, the same start-or-end-at-rest structure - with the dolly's sign flipped so
 * that each move does what its name says. Flagged for the plan to correct section 8.
 *
 * The labels go through `t()` HERE, at module scope, for the reason PANEL_SHORTCUTS
 * states: literal `t('…')` call sites are what scripts/translate.ts's corpus scan
 * extracts, and a `t(preset.label)` at render time would need every name hand-listed
 * in extra-keys.spa.json instead.
 *
 * The `track` times are AUTHORED absolutes (4–5.2 s); `applyCameraPreset` rescales them
 * to the scene's own duration (`rescaleKfTrack`, audit A1#5) so a move fits any clip.
 */

 * The shortest a rescaled preset may become - a floor under `applyCameraPreset`'s scene
 * scale so a pathologically brief scene compresses the move to a fast glide rather than a
 * single-frame strobe. Only bites below 0.8 s, which no real flythrough scene reaches.

  // ── P2: the two tilt moves ────────────────────────────────────────────────
  //
  // SURFACE GLIDE is the signature move. section 9's re-sequencing verdict said: "what I'm
  // seeing show up are all top-down views, not angled glides along the surface of
  // the image, POV style". The acceptance phrase was "to feel INSIDE the landscape
  // of the image". The move opens down among the lifted surfaces: `rx −40` pitches
  // the camera so the near edge sits at the bottom of frame and the far edge
  // recedes to a horizon. The focus plane sits out at z 160 with the aperture open,
  // so the flat board is soft and only the lifted layers are sharp. It then drifts
  // laterally (per the P4 study: "the camera NEVER sits still") and RESOLVES: pitch,
  // both pans, focus, and aperture all land on 0 at 5.2s, the same instant the
  // shipped Screenshot-flythrough template settles on. It is linear out of the
  // first key, because a drift that eases is a drift that wobbles, and ease-out
  // into the second key, so the shot settles rather than stops.
  //
  // ⚑ NO DOLLY. This is a MEASURED decision, not an omission. A `camZ` push was
  // tried and removed: on the affine tier camZ is a pure magnification, but under a
  // pitch it also DISPLACES, because it moves the aim point along the world z axis
  // instead of along the camera's own view axis. Measured on the P1 demo scene,
  // adding `z −180` to the opening key lifted every layer about 130px up the frame
  // on top of the magnification, and pushed two of the four lifted cards clean off
  // the top edge (card B to y −110 on a 540-tall stage). A signature preset must
  // not open with half the artwork out of frame. Dollying ALONG the view axis under
  // tilt is the right fix, but it is a projection change, not a preset one. Noted
  // for P2b.
  //
  // ORBIT is no longer inert. It shipped disabled at P1 with the reason "Needs tilt
  // (coming)". That reason no longer applies as of this milestone: the engine's
  // camera model ORBITS its aim point rather than swivelling in place (see
  // `surfaceMatrix`), so a keyframed `ry` IS an orbit: the camera swings around the
  // artwork while the centre of frame stays put. This codebase's rule is not to
  // leave a control dimmed behind a reason that has stopped being true. The move
  // swings right, past the front, to the left, and settles square, returning like
  // its sibling move, with a shallow `rx` through the arc so it reads as an orbit
  // rather than a horizontal wipe.
