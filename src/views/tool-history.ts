/**
 * The tool view's undo/redo model - pure, DOM-free, testable.
 *
 * Extracted from views/tool.ts for maintainability-2026-07-29.md item 2, the
 * second increment after views/catalog-filter.ts. Same shape as the pattern that
 * already works in this repo (free-canvas-math.ts, timeline-math.ts): the view
 * keeps the wiring - the runtime, the toasts, the button sync - and this module
 * owns the rules.
 *
 * WHY THIS CLUSTER. Its own comments in tool.ts record two bugs that already
 * shipped here, and both are the kind only a unit test catches:
 *
 *   1. The recorded-value filter was once a `blob:` URL test, which silently
 *      disabled ALL undo in Design the moment any box image resolved
 *      through the asset-blob cache. The rule is about raw BYTES in memory, not
 *      about the URL scheme - an asset ref carrying a blob: URL is perfectly
 *      recordable because it re-derives its URL from a durable source + id.
 *   2. Coalescing keyed off the top entry rather than off the last RECORD meant a
 *      post-undo edit could merge into a stale entry and lose a state.
 *
 * Neither is visible in a type signature, and neither had a test.
 *
 * The model is deliberately time-injected (`now` is a parameter, never
 * `Date.now()`), so gesture coalescing is testable without faking the clock.

 * restored entry would point at a dead URL - and deep-cloning megabytes per
 * entry is wasteful.
 *
 * Note what this does NOT test: the URL. A `blob:`/`data:` URL *without* bytes is
 * fine to record, because an asset ref ({source, id, url}) re-derives its URL
 * from the durable source + id. Testing the scheme instead of the bytes is the
