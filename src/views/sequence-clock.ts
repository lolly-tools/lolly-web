 * sequence-clock.ts - the playhead (Fable timeline, phase 2 section 3).
 *
 * One mounted composition's *time*: where the playhead is, what that means for
 * every timed box on the live canvas, and - while playing - a conductor that keeps
 * the <video>s, the Lottie players and the wall clock in step.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THIS MODULE LIVES BY: it is a READER. Timing comes exclusively from
 * the DOM the tool hook already stamped (`data-t-start` & friends on each
 * `.lolly-box`, `data-seq-ms` on the `[data-sequence]` artboard). It never reads the
 * input model, never calls `runtime.setInput`, never runs a hook and never writes
 * innerHTML. Everything it *does* write - one class and two inline properties per
 * box - is captured first and restored exactly on `destroy()`, so removing the clock
 * leaves every declaration as it found it. That is what lets a scrub run at
 * 60 Hz with zero re-renders and zero undo-stack entries.
 *
 * Composition, not clobbering: a box carries AUTHORED inline styles from the hook - 
 * `transform:rotate(-4deg)`, `opacity:0.8`. An entrance animation must add to those,
 * never replace them, so the authored string is captured once per element and the
 * animation is rebuilt around it every frame (declaration-identical, not byte-identical:
 * writing through CSSStyleDeclaration re-serialises the whole `style` attribute, so
 * nothing downstream may diff innerHTML and expect a match):
 *
 *     translate(dx,dy)  <authored…>  rotate(animRot)  scale(sc)
 *
 * which multiplies out to the same matrix order the video compositor uses in
 * bridge/export.ts (`translate → rotate(authored+anim) → scale`), so a scrubbed
 * preview and the rendered file agree. The transition maths itself is IMPORTED from
 * lib/transitions.ts - never re-derived here.
 *
 * Master clock is `AudioContext.currentTime`, not `performance.now()`: audio is the
 * one media element that cannot be nudged without an audible artefact, so everything
 * else is slaved to its timebase. Videos free-run and are re-seeked only when they
 * drift past ~80 ms.
 *
 * AUDIO BOXES ARE SCHEDULED, NOT DRIVEN. A `[data-audio-src]` box has no element to
 * play - the tool hook emits an inert marker div - so each one is handed to that same
 * AudioContext as a single `AudioBufferSourceNode.start(when, offset, duration)`,
 * placed once, ahead of time, against `t0`. The frame loop never advances it: it only
 * asserts the invariant "every box that should be sounding has a placement", and every
 * exit from playback (pause, seek, repaint, hidden tab, destroy) stops the sources
 * outright. Semantics are the export mix's, so preview and file agree - see driveAudio.
 *
 * Seeks are strictly serialised per element (the Safari rule - a seek issued while
 * another is in flight is silently cancelled, so scrubbing returns a lottery of
 * frames). The queue is the shared, already-tested one from lib/clip-thumbs.ts; this
 * module adds only what playback needs on top: latest-wins scrub throttling and a
 * single confirm-and-nudge retry when a decoder lands short of the requested time.
 *
 * NOT EVERY AUDIO SOURCE IS A CONTAINER. A box may carry a TRACKER MODULE
 * (.mod/.xm/.it/.s3m/.stm/.mtm) - a score plus its instrument samples, not encoded
 * audio, so `decodeAudioData` cannot parse a byte of it. Those are rendered to PCM by
 * libopenmpt (lib/mod-render.ts, lazily imported) and enter the ordinary decode cache
 * as an AudioBuffer, so everything downstream - the ceilings, the abort plumbing, the
 * scheduling triple - is unchanged. See "tracker modules" below for how one is
 * recognised, and bridge/sequence-providers.ts for the export half of the same story.
 *
 * BROWSER-ONLY SURFACES (deliberately isolated behind injectable seams so the rest is
 * unit-testable in jsdom): `AudioContext`, `requestVideoFrameCallback`,
 * `requestAnimationFrame`, and real layout for box sizes.

// A .mod/.xm/.it/.s3m/.stm/.mtm file is a SCORE plus the instrument samples it plays - 
// there is no encoded audio stream in it at all. `decodeAudioData` fails on one and so
// does mediabunny; the only thing in this codebase that can turn it into sound is

// something has to say "this is a module" - and that is harder than it sounds:
//
//   • THE FORMAT FIELD WOULD BE THE BEST SIGNAL AND IS NOT AVAILABLE HERE. An uploaded
//     asset's `AssetRef.format` is exactly 'mod'/'xm'/… (that is what the export bar
//     switches on - views/tool-actions.ts, `isModuleFormat(r.format)`), but the
//     sequence tool's hook emits only `data-audio-src="<url>"`, so by the time a box
//     reaches this module the format has been thrown away. Recovering it means a new
//     `data-audio-format` attribute in community/sequence-studio/hooks.js - reported,
//     not done here.
//   • THE EXTENSION IS NOT ENOUGH. A user upload resolves to a `blob:` URL minted by
//     bridge/assets.ts (`URL.createObjectURL`) with no path, no extension and a MIME
//     type of whatever the OS guessed - and an upload is the ONLY way a module gets
//     into a composition today (no brand catalog ships one; the picker accepts
//     .mod/.xm/.it/.s3m/.stm/.mtm as uploads).
//
// So the signal is the BYTES, with the extension as a free fast path when there is
// one. Both live here, pure and exported, and bridge/sequence-providers.ts imports
// them for the export mix - one definition, so preview and export can never disagree
// about what is a module. (That import direction, bridge → this file, is the same
// read-only reuse the seek helpers below already have; the reverse would be a cycle.)
