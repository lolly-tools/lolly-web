/**
 * Pen chrome CONTRAST (styles/parts/editor.css).
 *
 * The pen's path preview, nodes, handles and arms were all painted in a single flat
 * --primary: on a shape filled with the brand colour they disappeared outright, and the
 * arms (a 1px hairline at 60%) disappeared against almost anything. The fix is a dual
 * halo - a light casing tight around each mark, a dark edge just beyond it - so one of
 * the two always separates from the backdrop.
 *
 * This is a purely visual rule and jsdom applies no stylesheet, so there is nothing to
 * assert on a rendered node; the rule TEXT is what gets guarded, exactly as
 * tool-stage-nav.test.ts and free-canvas-rail.test.ts do for the HUD and the rail. What
 * is NOT covered here, and is checked by hand in a browser: how the halo actually looks
 * over a white artboard, a brand-filled shape, a black shape and a photograph.
