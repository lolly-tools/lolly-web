/**
 * Table-cell DRIFT GUARD — a static read of parts/tool.css.
 *
 * A table cell is markup-identical to a sidebar field (a bare `<input>` /
 * `<textarea>` inside an `.input-row`) but is NOT one: it is a cell in a grid,
 * flat and content-sized, and it must opt out of the shared field recipes. The
 * codebase already spells that opt-out `:not(.table-cell)` — but it has to be
 * repeated on every `.input-row input` / `.input-row textarea` rule, and a rule
 * that forgets it wins anyway on specificity: `.input-row textarea` is (0,1,1)
 * against `.table-cell`'s (0,1,0), so the cell's own declarations lose no matter
 * what order they appear in or how emphatically they are written.
 *
 * That is exactly how `resize: vertical` and `min-height: 80px` reached the grid:
 * one of the two textarea recipes carried the opt-out and the other didn't. The
 * visible symptom was a drag handle on every cell (dragging one left its row
 * ragged, since its neighbours stayed content-sized). No runtime test can see it
 * — nothing is wrong with the DOM, only with which rule won — so it is asserted
 * here, structurally.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow: this does not police what the field recipes CONTAIN (those
 * are design choices), only that they cannot reach a `.table-cell`.
 *
 * Run directly:  node --test shells/web/src/views/table-cell-contract.test.ts
