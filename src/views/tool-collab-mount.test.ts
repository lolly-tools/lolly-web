/**
 * INERTNESS: mounting a tool must cost a single-player user nothing to be a collab
 * (plan 100 §4.6, §5, §11.14).
 *
 * `views/tool.ts` now contains one block that can build an entire presence stack - a
 * session, an op wrapper, an overlay layer, two frame-driven components, a stage pill
 * and a document-level listener set. Nothing in this repo registers a session source,
 * so that block is dead code, and the whole value of this task rests on it STAYING
 * dead in a way you can check rather than a way you can assert in prose.
 *
 * WHY A SOURCE SCAN. mountTool cannot be imported outside Vite - it imports
 * stylesheets and reaches `tool-inputs.ts`, whose sibling imports use the `.js`
 * specifier convention Node cannot resolve (the reason `views/block-row-id.test.ts`
 * and `views/multi-edit-crash-guard.test.ts` scan rather than mount). So the proof is
 * split three ways, and this file owns only the third:
 *
 *   - `lib/collab-session-source.test.ts` drives the real registry: dormant by
 *     default, allocation-free while dormant, and unable to fail a mount.
 *   - `views/tool-collab.test.ts` mounts the real composition against jsdom and
 *     proves it stays out of the render surface and tears down to nothing.
 *   - THIS FILE proves the wiring in between: that the composition is reached only
 *     through the guard and only through a lazy `import()`, that the single-player
 *     paint path, resize path and teardown carry nothing but optional calls on
 *     holders that stay null, and that a navigation mid-import cannot leak a live
 *     transport.
 *
 * Run directly:  node --test shells/web/src/views/tool-collab-mount.test.ts
