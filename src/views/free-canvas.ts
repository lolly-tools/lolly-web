// free-canvas.js - the WYSIWYG direct-manipulation overlay for render.layout:'editor'.
//
// This is the ONLY DOM in the free-canvas feature. All geometry lives in the pure,
// unit-tested free-canvas-math.js. It mounts:
//   • a left toolbar (add / arrange / align / canvas background),
//   • a selection overlay (rotated outlines + 8 resize handles + a rotate handle),
//   • a contextual bar (fill / text controls / duplicate / delete + a transform readout),
// all as SIBLINGS of #tool-canvas inside #tool-stage. They live OUTSIDE the
// exported node (runtime.export is handed #tool-canvas), so they never appear in
// the output. They also carry [data-export-hide] as a backstop.
//
// The overlay reads box geometry from the MODEL (runtime.getModel) and maps native
// canvas pixels to screen pixels via the live canvasEl rect. This works regardless
// of transform: it combines fitCanvas's scale with stageNav's pan/zoom
// automatically. Edits mutate the box DOM directly for smooth feedback during a
// gesture, then commit ONE runtime.setInput on release, which the shell's undo
// wrapper coalesces into a single history step.
//
// Opt-in and progressive: without this overlay the same flat `boxes` array renders
// identically headless (CLI/URL). The engine and URL never see the editor.
//
// ── THE ONE RULE (sequence editing) ──────────────────────────────────────────
// On a time-capable tool (`timeCfg`) the canvas is a window onto ONE instant. One
// rule governs everything the user can touch:
//
//   "The canvas edits exactly what the canvas shows at the playhead. Moving the
//    playhead never changes the selection; selecting in the timeline moves the
//    playhead so the selection stays live; when a selection is nevertheless
//    off-playhead, the canvas says so and offers to reconcile. The timeline
//    inspector and the sidebar are the precision fallbacks and are never gated
//    by time."
//
// This rule is enforced in three places, on purpose, because enforcing it in only
// one place would leave a gap:
//   1. ACQUISITION - `seqHiddenSkip` makes a click fall THROUGH a hidden box to
//      the visible one beneath (no toast: in a stacked scene composition that
//      would fire on every click).
//   2. RETENTION - `paintChrome` suppresses the outline, all 8 resize handles,
//      the rotate handle and the contextual bar when the selection is not live,
//      so no pointer path can start a gesture on something nobody can see. The
//      chrome is positioned from the MODEL - mapped through the pose the playhead
//      has the box in, and an off-screen box has none - so without this it would
//      paint full editing controls at the authored rect, over nothing.
//   3. KEYBOARD - `onKey` refuses every mutating key on an off-playhead
//      selection, because a nudge or a Delete needs no visible controls at all.
// Plus the reconciliation: an off-playhead selection raises the `.fc-offplayhead`
// banner, whose button dispatches `fc-seek` at the box's own start. The timeline
// panel answers it, and reports the playhead position back via `tl-time`.
//
// Deliberately NOT built: a "selection follows playhead" preference. Premiere
// ships one and users still lose work to it: letting time change the selection
// destroys work.

   * Returns both halves because the seeding rewrites rows in `boxes`; the caller must

  // ── Lift layers (plans/104 section 7) ───────────────────────────────────────────────
  //
  // "The feature that makes this especially for vectors": one box holding a flat SVG
  // becomes N stacked boxes, one per layer of the drawing, sharing a group, with their
  // depth auto-staggered and `shadow: depth` pre-set - at which point every layer is an
  // ordinary plate with its own z, keyframes and blur, and the rest of this plan works
  // on it unchanged. Zero new machinery downstream; the whole feature is here plus the
  // engine's enumerator.
  //
  // The division of labour, and why nothing below re-implements any of it:
  //   • `enumerateSvgLayers` (engine, 1.119) reads the sanitised markup and derives one
  //     STANDALONE `<svg>` per layer, in the source's own root coordinates - which is
  //     what makes the geometry identity hold (N layers at z = 0 render as the original).
  //   • `liftRows` + `applyLift` (free-canvas-math) synthesise the rows and splice them
  //     in place, including the paint-order distribution (bg on the bottom row, text on
  //     the top) that keeps a lift from compositing the background N times.
  //   • `storeUserUpload` (picker) is the ONE ingest funnel: every derived document goes
  //     through DOMPurify again on the way in, exactly like a file the user dragged.
  //
  // ONE commit for the whole thing, so one ⌘Z puts the original box back.

  /**
   * The confirm dialog: what the lift WILL do, before it does it.
   *
   * The `fc-panel` recipe `askConfirm` established - a titled panel with a sentence and
   * two buttons, riding `morePanel` so an outside click or Escape dismisses it and that
   * dismissal means "no". It grows one thing: the list of layers.
   *
   * The list is READ-ONLY, deliberately, and this is a v1 decision worth stating. section 7
   * calls it a "checklist preview", and the obvious reading is checkboxes - but an
   * unticked layer has nowhere to go: dropping it would silently delete artwork the
   * user never asked to lose, and merging it into a neighbour is a semantic section 7 does not
   * define. So v1 SHOWS the plan and asks yes or no to all of it; per-layer control
   * belongs with the Objects panel (plan 100), which is section 7's own stated home for the
   * list. No thumbnails either: rendering N derived documents to preview them costs a
   * rasteriser and a frame each, and the label plus the element count already answers
   * the only question the dialog is asked ("did it find my layers, or one big blob?").
   *
   * Two async stages, one panel: it opens IMMEDIATELY in a reading state (the fetch +
   * sanitise + enumerate can take a moment on a large file, and a menu item that does
   * nothing visible for half a second reads as broken), then re-renders in place with
   * the plan, or with the enumerator's own refusal in its own words.
   *
   * That second stage is the whole reason this panel is built in THREE pieces (head,
   * a live `[data-lift-msg]` sentence, a swapped `[data-lift-body]`) rather than one
   * `innerHTML` per stage. "Reading the artwork…" is a picture of work in flight, and
   * a picture is all it was: the panel opened without focus and repainted wholesale
   * whenever the enumeration landed, so a screen reader was told nothing at open and
   * nothing at the finish - and then focus jumped to a button that had appeared out of
   * a silence. Three habits the shell already has fix it:
   *
   *   • `aria-busy` on the container while it reads (template-chooser's tile,
   *     tool-actions' export button, color-lab's charts section);
   *   • ONE `role="status"` sentence that OUTLIVES both stages, so the outcome is a
   *     mutation of a mounted live region rather than a new region nobody announces;
   *   • focus taken at OPEN (askConfirm's move, and it is the user's own gesture that
   *     opened this), then moved WITHIN the panel afterwards - `focusInPanel` declines
   *     when the user has since gone somewhere else, because a control that appears
   *     after an await has no claim on where they went while it loaded.

   * What gets measured is the on-screen TYPE, not the box: a tapped-out text box is ~320×200
   * native, which clears any box-height threshold at fit zoom while its 64px type is still a

   * inflates that ratio (a client rect is the AABB), which only ever under-reports the need
   * to zoom, so it can produce no surprise movement.

   * The zoom goes through `fc-focus-rect`, the overlay's ONLY channel to the pan/zoom
   * transform (tool.ts holds the StageNav). focusRect frames a CLIENT rect at 85% of the

   * The rect the chrome for box `i` is drawn on: the live DOM rect mid-gesture (else

   *
   * ⚑ plans/104 section 9.15. The chrome used to be placed from the model ALONE, which is
   * right for an untimed board and wrong the moment a keyframe or a camera moves the
   * box: the outline and all eight handles drew at the authored rect while the artwork
   * sat somewhere else entirely, so the user was offered editing controls over a patch
   * of empty canvas. Section 6.5's rule is that chrome goes through the same fold the
   * render did, and `seqPoseId` is that fold - read back from the applier, never
   * re-evaluated here.
   *
   * The MODEL is still what a gesture writes (an off-diamond edit moves the base; see
   * section 8's latch), so this deliberately changes where the controls are drawn and
   * nothing about what they do.
   *
   * A box with a LIVE rect is the exception, and not an arbitrary one: `applyLiveRect`
   * writes `transform: rotate(...)` straight onto the element, which CLOBBERS the
   * applier's composed pose for the duration of the drag. So mid-gesture the box really
   * is unposed on screen, and posing its chrome would be the original bug with the
   * signs reversed. The live rect is used verbatim, exactly as it always was.

  /**
   * Chrome that puts focusable controls over the canvas opts out of the canvas keyboard
   * by marking its own root `data-canvas-keys="off"`: the Design top bar, the right edge
   * dock column, the navigator column. The verbs in `onKey` are bound on `window`, so
   * without this a focused button in one of those roots was a live canvas surface -
   * Delete on the Export button removed the selection, an arrow key in a menu nudged a
   * box. One attribute check covers every such root, rather than a growing class list.
   *
   * The event target AND the deep active element are both tested: a pointer-focused
   * button is the target, while a jelly text field keeps its real input in a shadow root
   * (the event retargets to the host, which is what `closest` can walk).
   *
   * The two exemptions are the ones those roots already make by hand where they stop
   * their own keys (`onRootKey` in design-topbar.ts and design-navigator.ts), so the
   * attribute says the same thing rather than something stricter: app-wide chords carry
   * meta/ctrl and mean the same wherever focus is, and Escape is how you leave a mode,
   * a draft or a selection, so it belongs to the ladder below from anywhere.
   *
   * The NEAREST marked ancestor decides, so a surface inside one of those roots can say
   * `data-canvas-keys="on"` and get the canvas keys back. The tool rail needs exactly
   * that: it is a canvas palette that free-canvas parks inside the navigator column while
   * that column is open, and without the opt-back-in `v` armed the pointer tool from a
   * floating rail and did nothing from a docked one - the same button, two meanings.
