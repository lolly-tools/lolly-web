/**
 * Deep output in the export panel — the pro-format grouping and the depth fact
 * (plans/61-deeprichpixels.md §10 item 3).
 *
 * Both halves obey the plan's governing rule, DEPTH FOLLOWS PROVENANCE.
 *
 * 1. `isProFormat` names the float interchange formats (OpenEXR, Radiance RGBE).
 *    They are compositing/VFX containers, not peers of png/jpg, so the picker
 *    puts them under their own <optgroup> — a native one, which costs no CSS and
 *    no space and carries its own a11y semantics. The group is built only from
 *    formats that SURVIVED the picker's support filter, so where they cannot be
 *    produced there is no group and no option. Today that is everywhere on the
 *    web: `proFormatSupport()` (bridge/format-support.ts) is false, because the
 *    engine's EXR/Radiance writers are fed by a resvg float rasterisation that
 *    only the Node shell has.
 *
 * 2. `depthFact` STATES what the pipeline will write; it is not a setting. When
 *    an HDR PNG is written at 16 bits the user has no decision to make, and a
 *    control would imply one that does not exist. The one honest control is the
 *    opposite direction (`?depth=8`, to keep a file small) and it already works
 *    through the URL with no UI.
 *
 * The fact is derived from the real export path, never from a list of formats
 * that "feel deep":
 *
 *   png  + hdr  → bridge/export-hdr-png.ts: a 16-bit IDAT written by the engine's
 *                 own PNG writer. `depth=8` is IGNORED there (8-bit PQ IS the
 *                 banding defect), so the fact holds whatever the link asked for.
 *   jpeg + hdr  → bridge/export-gainmap-jpeg.ts: an ordinary SDR JPEG with the HDR
 *                 rendition appended as an ISO 21496-1 gain map. Not deeper bytes,
 *                 so it is a different fact. `depth=8` DOES opt out here (back to
 *                 the legacy 8-bit PQ path), so the fact disappears with it.
 *
 * Everything else the web shell writes is 8 bits per channel — including HDR
 * AVIF and HDR TIFF, which still take the legacy 8-bit transform — and says
 * nothing at all. Absence is the information.
