/**
 * tool-collab - the presence chrome of ONE mounted tool, composed (plan 100 section 4.6, section 5).
 *
 * `views/tool.ts` owns a single guarded block that asks whether this mount is part of
 * a collab and, if it is, imports this module. Everything the answer "yes" costs - a
 * session, an overlay layer, remote focus rings, a cursor ticker, a stage pill, and
 * the exact undo for all five - lives here and nowhere else.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS A SEPARATE MODULE, NOT A HUNDRED LINES OF `mountTool` ───────────
 *
 * Two reasons, both of them properties a reviewer can check rather than preferences.
 *
 * 1. IT MUST COST A SINGLE-PLAYER BUILD NOTHING. `collab-pill.ts`'s own header sets
 *    that rule ("a collab is lazy chrome that must cost a single-player build
 *    nothing"), and a static import from the tool view would break it silently: the
 *    session, the palette derivation, the presence engine, the pill, the rings and
 *    the cursors would ride the tool chunk into every mount that will never use
 *    them. Reached through one `import()` inside the guard, they are a chunk that is
 *    never fetched - the same treatment `neuro-dock`/`music-player` get.
 * 2. `mountTool` CANNOT BE TESTED. It imports stylesheets and reaches modules that
 *    resolve siblings with `.js` specifiers, so no suite outside Vite can mount it - 
 *    which is why the tool view's guards are all source scans. This module imports
 *    neither, so the composition is exercised for real against jsdom: mounted,
 *    driven, and torn down with the leak assertions that actually matter.
 *
 * ── THE INVARIANT THAT OUTRANKS EVERY OTHER ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * NOTHING HERE WRITES INTO THE RENDER. The canvas is passed to be MEASURED and read;
 * the rings and cursors paint on an overlay layer `mountOverlayLayer` deliberately
 * climbs OUT of it, and the pill is a child of the stage. A collaborator's presence
 * must not be able to change a single byte of an exported PNG (section 4.6, section 8) - and the
 * sidebar is the one surface decorated in place, because the sidebar is chrome and
 * is never exported.
 *
 * The one exception to "read only" that is not an exception: remote focus is painted
 * from element RECTS, never by writing a class or an attribute into tool DOM. A
 * template repaint swaps `innerHTML` wholesale, so a decoration written into it
 * would be destroyed on the next keystroke and the layer would drift out of sync
 * with the document it decorates.

 * JSON.parses a numeric-keyed object where a Uint8Array belongs, plus a `blob:` URL from

     * received beam is a gift the human accepted by name and section 6.4 promises it lands in
