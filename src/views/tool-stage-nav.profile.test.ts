/**
 * Where the profile avatar lives on a canvas stage (plan 179, the right-dock wave).
 *
 * There is ONE avatar node in the Design editor and two surfaces that can show it: the
 * top bar (views/design-topbar.ts) while the right column is closed, and the compact
 * zoom bar in the column while it is open. The bar hands the node over and takes it back
 * - `profileHome()` is the address it hands it to - so what has to hold here is that the
 * address exists in editor layout and is null when there is no pill to hand it to.
 * Missing that, the bar hid its own avatar and the column had none: no profile menu
 * anywhere for as long as the column stayed open, which is exactly what shipped.
 *
 * The fold gesture is the second half. A long-press on the avatar folds the floating
 * pill behind the swirl, and that binding assumes the avatar is permanently the pill's.
 * In editor layout it is on loan and the pill is a docked bar that must not fold at all,
 * so the binding is not made there - the inline `touch-action` it writes is the visible
 * proof either way.
 *
 * Run directly:  node --import ./tests/css-stub.mjs --test shells/web/src/views/tool-stage-nav.profile.test.ts
