/**
 * "Bulk from rows" (plans/147 M1) - the tool view hands its template to /batch.
 *
 * The feature is one query param spelled in three files: the tool view mints
 * `#/batch?tool=<id>`, main.ts's batch route reads `tool` off the query and passes it
 * as `seedToolId`, and pro/index.ts seeds the grid with it. A rename in any one of the
 * three silently drops the preselect (the batch still opens, just empty), which is
 * exactly the kind of break a test has to catch, so the param name is pinned on all
 * three sides here.
 *
 * The second half pins the two HOMES of the action, because one layout having it and
 * another not is the failure this package exists to fix: the sidebar-header button for
 * the standard layouts, the Lolly-menu item for the chromeless editors.
 *
 * WHY A SOURCE SCAN: none of the four modules can be imported outside Vite - main.ts
 * boots the app, pro/index.ts and the two views pull in stylesheets and view chunks -
 * and mountTool needs a real loaded tool plus a host bridge. Same reasoning, and the
 * same stripComments helper, as views/projects-add-seed.test.ts.
 *
 * Run directly:  node --test shells/web/src/views/bulk-from-rows.test.ts
