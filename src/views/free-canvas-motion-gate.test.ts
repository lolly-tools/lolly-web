/**
 * The motion path's OPEN GATE (plans/104 §8) - free-canvas's half of the overlay.
 *
 * `motion-path.test.ts` owns the module: its export contract, its geometry, its
 * reduced-motion branch. What it cannot see is the sentence free-canvas writes above
 * `motionIds`: "shown for SELECTED animated boxes only, and only while the timeline is
 * OPEN", because a path drawn with no playhead, no diamonds and no transport in sight
 * is a picture of a move the user cannot currently reach.
 *
 * Four claims, and the second one is why this file exists:
 *
 *   1. closed panel → the chunk is never even fetched (the gate is cheap, and it is
 *      first, so an ordinary selection of ordinary boxes costs nothing);
 *   2. CLOSING an already-mounted panel takes the path down. The panel is not destroyed
 *      on that path - only its open state flips - so nothing tears the overlay down;
 *      something has to re-ASK the gate. `ensureTimeline` now does, on the toggle
 *      itself. It is not the only route (measured: `setOpen` → `reserve()` → the
 *      stage's inline `--stage-reserve-bottom` changes → the stage MutationObserver →
 *      scheduleSync → paintChrome), but that one is made of three other decisions and
 *      is nobody's stated contract; this test pins the OUTCOME, so either route
 *      satisfies it and losing both does not;
 *   3. re-opening brings it back - the gate is a state, not a one-way door;
 *   4. and a drag in flight does not move the path, because it cannot: the samples are
 *      the model's, no gesture writes the model while the pointer is down, and the memo
 *      is on the model array's identity. paintChrome's live-path skip is a saving, not
 *      a compromise - the commit at pointerup is what lets the line follow.
 *
 * The harness is free-canvas-kf-commit.test.ts's, unchanged: the real `initFreeCanvas`,
 * the real lazily-imported `timeline-panel.ts` and the real `motion-path.ts`, over an
 * in-memory runtime that echoes `setInput` back through `getModel`.
 *
 * Run directly:  node --test shells/web/src/views/free-canvas-motion-gate.test.ts
