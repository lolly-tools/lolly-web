/**
 * Shell-side <video> position keeper for the tool canvas.
 *
 * The tool canvas is rebuilt via `contentEl.innerHTML` on every rAF-coalesced
 * paint, which DESTROYS each <video> and the template emits a fresh one — so a
 * placed clip would restart at 0 on every edit. This enhancer remembers where each
 * keyed video was (data-video-key; Layout Studio sets it to the box id) and seeks
 * the newly-painted element back there, so the clip appears to keep playing while
 * the user edits.
 *
 * Contrast with lottie-mount: that OWNS the players it creates and must reap them
 * or lottie-web's global rAF manager leaks. This owns NO elements — a native
 * <video autoplay muted loop> plays by itself; we only read/write currentTime on
 * whatever the latest paint produced. So there is nothing to leak and nothing to
 * reap; pure progressive enhancement (without it, the clip still plays, just from 0).
 *
 * It also does one load-bearing job for export: `mountVideoPlayers` resolves only
 * once every video has a decoded frame (readyState ≥ 2) or a cap elapses, so an
 * exporter that awaits its returned promise snapshots a real frame rather than a
 * blank, not-yet-decoded one — the same settledness contract mountLottiePlayers
 * gives the exporter.
 *
 * Marker attributes (on the <video> the template emits):
 *   data-video-key   required for tracking — a stable per-instance id (box id)
