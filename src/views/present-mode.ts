// present-mode.ts - the presentation-mode conductor (plan 112, M1).
//
// Turns a design frame document into a fullscreen, click-advanced DECK. The
// deck MODEL and every index/direction/state-class decision live in the pure, DOM-free
// present-math.ts; this file is the DOM half: it reads the rendered `.lolly-frame-page`
// nodes, builds a fixed full-viewport stage, drives transitions through a state-class
// contract, and handles keyboard / tap / overview / fullscreen / URL sync.
//
// WHY CLONES, NOT THE LIVE NODES. The plan sketched normalising the live frame pages in
// place (the sequence-dom record-and-restore contract). Two facts pushed this to a
// safer shape: (1) the design canvas sits under the free-canvas CAMERA transform,
// so a `position:fixed` page presented in place resolves against that transformed
// ancestor, not the viewport (the containing-block trap this codebase already fights in
// float panels). (2) Restore fidelity is the plan's #1 risk - a leaked transform means a
// wrong export later. Cloning the pages into a body-level stage means the ORIGINAL
// canvas DOM is never touched, so restore is not a discipline to get right - it is
// automatic (remove the stage; the editor underneath is byte-identical). Media/interactive
// continuity is preserved the same way the timeline preserves it: video-mount keys resume
// off `data-video-key`, which survives the clone. M2 layers real media conduct on top.
