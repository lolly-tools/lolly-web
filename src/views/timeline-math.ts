// Sibling of free-canvas-math.ts: that module owns the SPATIAL half of a `boxes`
// block input (x/y/w/h/rot in native px), this one owns the TEMPORAL half
// (start/dur/clipIn/speed/lane in seconds). Same contract, same habits - it reads a
// FLAT array of box rows plus a `cfg` naming the sub-fields that carry timing, it is
// pure (returns NEW boxes / arrays, never mutates), and it never touches the DOM, so
// every interaction edge case is unit-testable at the repo root rather than trapped
// inside the panel controller.
//
// Units: SECONDS everywhere in this module's inputs and box fields (that is what the
// manifest's time fields store). The ONE exception is deriveDuration, which returns
// MILLISECONDS because it must return the byte-identical number to the tool hook's
// seqDurationMs - the derived length the hook already stamps on the artboard as
// data-seq-ms. Getting those two to disagree is a real bug we have already hit once,
// so the clamps below are written to mirror the hook's line for line:
//
//   design/hooks.js: num / clamp / isFiniteNum / startSeconds / seqDurationMs
//
// Lanes: a box is on the SEQ lane (the magnetic, gapless row) when lane === 'seq'.
// A box with a finite `start` but no lane is an OVERLAY (free-floating in time). A box
// with neither is SCENERY - always visible, never timed, and invisible to every

//
// A keyframe track is authored in the box's OWN LOCAL TIME (ms from the clip's
// start, unscaled - `speed` remaps the MEDIA inside a clip, never the clip's own
// animation, so nothing here touches speed). That timebase is exactly what an edit
// to the clip's HEAD moves: cutting a clip in two gives the second half a new t = 0,
// and trimming the in-edge throws away the first d seconds of it. Without a rebase,
// a split would hand both halves the same track and the second one would replay the
// whole animation from its own start, a trim-in would slide the motion out from under
// the picture, and a join would silently drop the second clip's track.
//
// Three rules, and the reasons they differ:
//   • SPLIT at local `c` - A keeps the keys before `c` plus a synthesised pose key AT
//     `c`; B gets that same pose at t = 0 followed by the later keys shifted −c.
//   • TRIM-IN by `d` - the same thing as B alone: shift −d·1000, synthesise t = 0,
//     drop what went negative. A NEGATIVE trim-in (dragging the edge back out) only
//     shifts, since the newly revealed head is already covered by the track's
//     clamp-hold before its first key.
//   • TRIM-OUT / setDuration - NO rebase. Shortening the tail cannot move local t = 0,
//     and clamp-hold covers everything past the last key; leaving the keys in place is
//     what lets a later re-extension bring the motion back.
//   • JOIN - A's keys, then B's shifted by A's length, one key at the seam.
//
// The subtle half is the EASE. A segment interpolating `av → bv` through eased
// progress `E` that is cut at the time fraction λ does not leave two segments with
// the same ease: the first needs `E(u·λ)/E(λ)` and the second `(E(λ + (1−λ)u) −
// E(λ))/(1 − E(λ))`, the de Casteljau halves of the curve. `subdivideKfEase` is that
// (engine, with goldens); this module only decides WHERE to cut.
//
// Exactness, stated once so the tests can pin it: the halves reproduce the original's
// value at the cut and at every key EXACTLY (to the wire's own quanta), and reproduce
// the whole curve when each keyframe poses the same set of channels - which is what
// the UI writes (section 8: "every diamond is a complete honest pose"). A hand-authored
// SPARSE track, where one channel's segment spans a keyframe that never mentions it,
// can have two different crossing segments at one cut; a keyframe carries ONE ease, so
// the subdivision is applied to the last key before the cut and any channel whose
// segment started earlier keeps the right endpoints but not the exact interior shape.

//     clip's animation, so it appears nowhere below. The DOM evaluator reads exactly
//     this (`evaluateKf(timing.kf, tMs - timing.start)`, sequence-dom.ts) and the
//     trim rebase above moves by exactly this, so all three agree by construction.

 * An OPEN-ENDED clip (no authored dur - it runs to the sequence end) splits too, when
 * the caller supplies `totalSec` to resolve its effective end: the left half gets the
 * authored span up to the cut, and the right half stays OPEN-ENDED - it keeps running
 * to the sequence end, exactly as the whole clip did, so the null-dur contract
 * ("derive from the media / follow the sequence") survives the cut on the half where
 * it still means something. Without `totalSec` an open-ended clip is refused as before.
 *
 * The transitions belong to the OUTER edges of the original clip: A keeps its enter
 * and loses its exit, B keeps its exit and loses its enter. B's source in-point
 * advances by the media time consumed by A - (t - start) * speed. B is inserted
 * immediately after A so z-order is preserved, and its id comes from the injected
 * `mintId` (this module never invents ids).
 *
 * The keyframe track is the one field that is REBASED rather than copied (section 5.6): a
 * verbatim copy would have B replay the whole animation from its own t = 0. Both
 * halves get a keyframe at the cut holding the pose the original struck there, and
 * the crossing segment's ease is subdivided so neither half's motion changes shape.
 * Everything else - the link field, the asset ref, the geometry - is copied exactly
 * as before.
