/**
 * First-visit offline nudge (web/PWA shell only) — the discoverability half of
 * the "Available offline" download manager (lib/offline-manager.ts).
 *
 * The feature exists for someone with a URL, an hour of airport wifi and a
 * flight — exactly the person who will never dig through the profile page to
 * find it. So the gallery surfaces it once, as a dismissible toast beside the
 * personalisation nudge (personalize-nudge.ts, whose placement and lifecycle
 * this mirrors), deep-linking to #/profile?focus=offline-section.
 *
 * Two copy variants, chosen by how the app is running:
 *   - a browser tab: "works offline once downloaded" — an invitation;
 *   - standalone (installed PWA, display-mode: standalone / iOS
 *     navigator.standalone): "finish installing" — a correction. Installing
 *     puts an icon on the device while precaching only the shell, so
 *     "installed" quietly means "online-only" until the app part is
 *     downloaded. The user must hear that HERE, not mid-flight.
 *
 * Lifecycle rules:
 *   - one at a time: the gallery renders this only when the personalisation
 *     nudge isn't showing (two toasts is nagging, not helping);
 *   - shown once — profile.offlineNudgeDismissed rides the PROFILE like the
 *     personalisation flag, and main.ts RE-CLEARS it on `appinstalled` so the
 *     standalone variant gets one fresh showing after an install;
 *   - self-suppressing: once any offline part or tool pin exists the user has
 *     found the feature, so the mount quietly removes the toast and records
 *     the flag (the markup renders before those async reads can answer).
