/**
 * Every `blocks` row is minted in ONE place, and the legacy migration runs in ONE
 * place - a source scan, not a mount.
 *
 * Plan 100 section 3 makes a row's id a property of its birth: `newBlockRow` (tool-inputs.ts)
 * builds the declared defaults AND the stable id together, so a row cannot exist without
 * one. That guarantee is only as good as the number of places that build a row, and the
 * sidebar has four (the "+ Add" button and its typed menu, drop-to-add, Markdown paste,
 * CSV/JSON import) - a fifth written the old way (`for (const f of fields) row[f.id] =
 * blockFieldDefault(f)`) would silently reintroduce id-less rows.
 *
 * The migration of rows saved BEFORE ids existed is the other half, and where it runs is
 * a correctness property, not a preference: `renderInputs` also draws `/multi`'s shared
 * card against a fan-out runtime whose model is the LEAD session's and whose `setInput`
 * writes to every sibling session declaring that id, so a migration from there would
 * overwrite each sibling's rows with the lead's - and mark them dirty - on mount. It
 * belongs to a mounted session (views/tool.ts), through the engine's `applyPatch`, which
 * records no undo step.
 *
 * A scan because tool-inputs.ts cannot be imported outside Vite (it resolves sibling
 * modules with `.js` specifiers) - the same reason multi-edit-crash-guard.test.ts scans
 * rather than mounts. The migration and ULID behaviour themselves are covered for real in
 * lib/row-id.test.ts and views/free-canvas-ids.test.ts.
 *
 * Run directly:  node --test shells/web/src/views/block-row-id.test.ts
