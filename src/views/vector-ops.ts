 * vector-ops.ts — the pure operations behind the canvas editor's vector-operations
 * context menu: boolean combine, offset, outline-stroke and simplify on a selection.
 *
 * DOM-free and synchronous, like free-canvas-math.ts, and for the same reason: the
 * overlay (free-canvas.ts) owns gestures and chrome, this module owns geometry, and only
 * geometry can be unit-tested. It may import the engine — shell code is allowed to, tools
 * are not — so the whole cubic kernel is available here without a bridge.
 *
 * Everything operates on a FLAT array of "box" records (rows of a `blocks` input) in
 * NATIVE canvas pixels. Array order is z-order: later = on top.
 *
 * ## boxToPath has to agree with the renderer, exactly
 *
 * A selection is arbitrary boxes — rects with a corner radius, pills, ellipses, rotated
 * anything, and pen paths. Each is lowered to a contour before it can be combined, and if
 * the lowering disagrees with what `hooks.js` paints even slightly, a union visibly does
 * not match the shapes the user selected. So `boxToPath` reproduces `boxCss`/`radiusFor`
 * in brands/<brand>/tools/design/hooks.js term for term, including the parts that
 * look like noise:
 *
 * - `x`/`y` are rounded to whole px and `w`/`h` are `max(1, round(v))` — a zero-width box
 *   paints as a 1px sliver, so that is what it lowers to.
 * - `rot` is rounded to one decimal, because the hook writes `rotate(<1dp>deg)`.
 * - `border-radius` is CLAMPED by CSS, and the clamp is the whole reason `pill` works:
 *   the hook emits `9999px` and the browser scales every radius by
 *   `f = min(side / sum of that side's two radii)`, which for a uniform radius is
 *   `min(w,h) / 2r`, so the painted radius is `min(r, min(w,h)/2)`. `pill` is therefore
 *   not a special shape at all, it is `min(9999, min(w,h)/2)`. See the repo note on the
 *   border-radius pill clamp — this has bitten before.
 * - `ellipse`/`circle` are `border-radius: 50%`, i.e. a true inscribed ellipse (the 50%
 *   radii sum to exactly the side length, so nothing clamps).
 *
 * Corners and ellipses are EXACT cubic arc approximations with the standard kappa
 * constant, never sampled: the kernel's premise is that no algorithm flattens, and
 * feeding it a 48-gon (which is what `clipCss` does for its clip-path polygon, because a
 * CSS polygon cannot curve) would throw that away at the first step.
 *
 * ## What has no outline
 *
 * `kind: 'text'` and `kind: 'image'` lower to NULL, not to their frame rectangle. Their
 * silhouette is glyph outlines or an image's alpha, and neither is available here; a
 * frame rect would union in a rectangle the user cannot see, which is exactly the
 * "silently wrong path" this module must never return. Callers get an explicit
 * `no-outline` failure (or a `skipped` list) instead — see `boxOutlineKind`.
 *
 * ## Coordinate convention for path boxes (fixed by plans/57-pen-tool-and-vector-ops.md)
 *
 * A path box's nodes are stored NORMALISED to the box frame: `x`/`y`/`w`/`h` is the
 * reference rectangle and node coordinates are fractions of it, legally outside [0,1].
 * That is what makes every existing gesture work unchanged — move writes x/y, resize
 * writes w/h, rotate writes rot, and the path follows.
 *
 * Nodes are scaled into box-local PIXELS first and lowered second. For `cubic`, `line`
 * and `bspline` the two orders agree exactly (those lowerings are affine), so this only
 * matters for `catmull-rom`, whose centripetal knot spacing is measured on real chord
 * lengths: lowering in normalised space and then applying a non-uniform box scale gives a
 * different curve. Stage C's `hooks.js` must lower in box-local pixels too (a
 * `viewBox="0 0 w h"`), or a resized Catmull-Rom path will render differently from what
 * the editor combined. Boolean output is always stored as `kind: 'cubic'`, which is
 * affine-invariant, so results round-trip regardless.

 * two shapes stays above whatever the upper one was above. `insertAt` is an index into the
 * ORIGINAL array; pass a negative number (or a non-index) to mean "topmost consumed".
 *
 * **Dangling clips.** `clip` holds another box's id, and consuming that box leaves the
 * reference pointing at nothing. Default is to RETARGET it to the result box: `hooks.js`
 * treats an unresolvable clip id as no clip at all, so clearing it and doing nothing look
 * identical to the renderer — both dump the full, unmasked artwork onto the canvas, which
 * is the loudest possible surprise and the hardest to undo by hand. Retargeting keeps the
 * masking relationship the user set up, aimed at the shape that now describes the same
 * region. It is only wrong when the result's region genuinely differs from the old mask's
 * (a difference, say), and in that case the mask visibly changed anyway. Callers who want
 * the other behaviour pass `clip: 'clear'`, which writes an empty string so at least the
 * data says what happened.
 *
 * **Group membership.** A consumed box may have been in a group. The result inherits the
 * group of the topmost consumed box — the same box whose z-position it takes — unless the
 * consumed boxes all shared one group, in which case that group wins regardless of order.
 * Groups left with a single surviving member are NOT touched: a one-member group selects
 * and drags exactly like an ungrouped box, so dissolving it would be an edit to boxes the
 * user did not select.
