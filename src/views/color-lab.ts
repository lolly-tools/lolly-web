/**
 * Colour Lab (#/lab) — one colour, comprehensively.
 *
 * A single scrolling report rather than a sidebar-and-stage tool: there is no
 * canvas to zoom and nothing to export, so the page IS the document. Every
 * control lives in the flow of the report, next to the thing it changes.
 *
 * ## Why a view and not a tool
 *
 * The interesting controls here are the shell's own: `mountColorField` with the
 * tabbed multi-space picker and the OKLCH rings/sliders. Tools are DATA — they
 * cannot import shell modules — so a tool version would have had to reimplement
 * the picker, which is the one component the component audit went out of its way
 * to unify. Being a view also means the page can simply be tall, which no
 * `render.layout` mode allows (every one of them keeps a fixed zoom-to-fit
 * stage). The cost, accepted deliberately: no CLI render, no URL-mode export.
 *
 * ## The order of the page is the order of the questions
 *
 *   1. **Set a colour** — in any space. The picker, a free-text field, the brand
 *      rail. This is the only thing a first-time visitor has to understand.
 *   2. **The charts** — where it sits, four ways, with the comparison-target
 *      control that governs what they draw: sRGB, Display-P3, Rec.2020, and a
 *      press profile of your own if you have added one. High up, because they
 *      are the reason to open the page.
 *   3. **Every notation** — the same colour written for each space, copyable.
 *   4. **Tones and blends** — ramps out of it: through its own lightness, and
 *      across to a second colour you choose, at a step count you set.
 *   5. **Displayable range and readability** — the verdict and the contrast
 *      scores. Real, but reference: you look them up once you have a candidate,
 *      so they sit at the bottom rather than in front of the charts.
 *
 * Easy at the top, detailed as you go down.
 *
 * Picking happens in five places — the picker, the text field, the brand rail,
 * a drag on any 2D chart, and any ramp step — and all of them funnel through
 * `setSubject`, so no two paths can disagree.
 *
 * ## The subject is never collapsed to sRGB
 *
 * The colour is kept as the string the user authored and described by the
 * engine's `describeColor`, so `color(display-p3 1 0 0)` is reported at its real
 * chroma (0.299) and its real gamut (P3) — not flattened to `#ff0000` and then
 * trivially declared sRGB-safe.
 *
 * It is also PAINTED from the authored value. Every swatch on this page sets the
 * colour as CSS wrote it, so a wide-gamut display shows the real thing and only a
 * narrower one falls back — the browser does that mapping itself, per display,
 * which is strictly better than us deciding in advance that nobody can see it.
 * `srgbHex` is used only where a hex is structurally unavoidable — the dots drawn
 * over the charts and the 3D canvas, which take a colour as a hex. The chart FILLS
 * are no longer among those places: they are painted in the display's own space
 * (lib/display-gamut.ts), so on a P3 screen the plot shows the real colour out to
 * P3's boundary. Where a hex does stand in, it is labelled rather than passed off
 * as the value.
 *
 * The picker is no longer one of those places: it is seeded with the authored string
 * and read back through its `detail.css`, so the subject survives a round trip
 * through the control at its real chroma. Its sliders still gamut-map what they
 * PAINT, which is a display honesty question, not a value one.
