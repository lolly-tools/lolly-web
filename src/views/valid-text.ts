 * /valid's TEXT-PAYLOAD logic - the C2PA 2.4 text bindings as the verify page has
 * to talk about them, plus the two policies that decide what the page will fetch.
 *
 * Pure by design, exactly like valid-verdict.ts: report/text in, a model out.
 * Zero DOM, zero network, zero side effects - valid.ts renders these models and
 * owns every `t()` / `escape()` call, so the copy can be tested as data and the
 * URL policy can be attacked in a test file instead of in a browser.
 *
 * Two rules run through all of it, and they are the reason this file exists
 * rather than a pile of template literals in the view:
 *
 *  1. **A carrier problem is not an accusation.** The engine reports a dozen
 *     distinct ways a text credential can be present-but-unusable (section A.7.1.4,
 *     section A.8.7.1, section A.9.3/section A.9.5, section 15.12.1.3), and most of them are producer bugs,
 *     truncated copies or invisible characters lost in a clipboard - NOT
 *     evidence that anyone changed the content. `manifest.inaccessible` in
 *     particular means "the credential is over there", and must never render as
 *     a broken one. Every string below is written to be true of the honest cause
 *     as well as the dishonest one.
 *  2. **Nothing is fetched on your behalf.** The page's own promise. A pasted
 *     URL and an external manifest reference are both resolved through the same
 *     same-origin gate (`classifyUrl`), and anything else is refused in
 *     words rather than followed quietly.

// The DUAL of `aiDisclosureRows` above: that reads what a credential DECLARES (an
// authoritative, signed statement); this READS THE TEXT ITSELF for signals that it
// was AI-generated. The two are meant to sit together - a declaration is stronger
// than a detection, and this panel is careful never to overstep it. A SIGNAL, never
// a verdict: the engine's `analyzeTextSignals` returns a coarse band plus findings,
// and this builds the view model. The view owns t()/escape and the copy for each
// `kind`, exactly like the notice mapping above. See [[perceptibility-is-not-a-safeguard]].
