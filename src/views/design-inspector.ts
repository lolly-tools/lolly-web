/**
 * The Design editor's INSPECTOR column - plan 179 M3, slice (c).
 *
 * A scrollable property column, shown in the app's one right sidebar (see LAYOUT
 * below), that replaces the
 * one-slot property panels (Text / More / Dims / Stroke / Frame state / CSS class /
 * Speaker notes / Morph match). Those panels shared a single slot, so opening one
 * closed the last, and every selection change tore the open one down: the editor
 * could show exactly one property of one box at a time. The column shows all of
 * them at once, gated by what the selection actually IS.
 *
 * WHAT IT OWNS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. Everything is injected through
 * `views/design-ports.ts`: the model (read the rows, write one field across the
 * selection in ONE commit), the selection, the active artboard, and the four verbs
 * that need the overlay's own code (`pickImage`, `openGradient`, `arrange`,
 * `openTimeline`). It imports nothing from `free-canvas.ts` or `tool.ts` - the row
 * builders it shares with the overlay live in `views/free-canvas-fields.ts` - so it
 * mounts and is tested on a bare jsdom stage against fakes.
 *
 * ONE COMMIT PER GESTURE. Every write is `model.setField(ids, field, value)`, which
 * is tool.ts's undo-coalescing `runtime.setInput` wrapper. `setInputNoHistory` is
 * never reachable from here, by construction: this module is not handed a runtime.
 * Text fields commit on `change` (at blur, not per keystroke), sliders on `change`
 * (pointer release / keyboard commit), and the number cells once per gesture of their
 * own (see `numField`) - so a drag is one undo step, not sixty.
 *
 * REPAINT DISCIPLINE. One `model.subscribe` handler, memoised on the selection ids
 * plus the WATCHED field values of the sections currently visible. An edit to a
 * field no visible section shows (a `notes` edit while a box is selected, the
 * timeline writing keyframes) leaves the DOM alone. A CLOSED column skips the work
 * entirely and repaints once on open. And a rebuild never runs while the user is
 * standing in something it would destroy - a caret in a text field, a number cell
 * being scrubbed, or an open colour popover (the picker emits on every slider `input`,
 * so rebuilding on its own echo would delete the popover mid-drag). Those rebuilds are
 * deferred and re-tried once the gesture settles. When a rebuild does land, the focused control
 * is re-found by its field identity and re-focused, because every non-text control
 * commits DURING the interaction: without that, one arrow key on a slider drops
 * focus to `<body>` and the second one scrolls the page.
 *
 * WRITES GO TO THE ROW THE CONTROL WAS BUILT FOR, not to `selection.get()` at event
 * time. A text field commits at BLUR, and its rebuild is deferred while the caret is
 * in it, so the row outlives the selection it was rendered from: reading the live
 * selection wrote speaker notes typed for one slide onto whatever the canvas had
 * selected by the time the caret left.
 *
 * LAYOUT: IT OWNS NONE OF IT (2026-09-02). The column is built DETACHED and positions
 * nothing. The app has ONE right sidebar - the dock column in lib/edge-dock.ts - and the
 * host puts this panel in a slot there, so the root is a plain block that fills whatever
 * slot it is given, `width()` is always 0 (the dock owns the width, and the one
 * `--dock-w` inset nudges the view), and nothing here writes `--stage-reserve-*` or
 * dispatches `canvas-resize`. Before this, the column absolutely positioned itself over
 * the stage AND reserved 280px, which is how the editor ended up with two right-hand
 * columns side by side - this one inside the stage, the export dock beside it.
 *
 * Being in a slot IS being open: the panel follows `onDockChange`, so the header's close
 * button (which reports through `onClose`) and the top bar's toggle can never disagree
 * about whether it is there. `setOpen` stays for the host and for a standalone mount.
 *
 * EVERY GROUP COLLAPSES (2026-09-03). Each group is a `<section>` with a real button
 * header carrying `aria-expanded`, including the five that used to run as one flat list
 * inside Object (Fill & Stroke, Appearance, Shadow, Perspective tilt, Arrange) - a
 * shadowed text box on a phone was otherwise a column of forty rows with no way to put
 * any of it away. What the user leaves open is remembered per device under
 * {@link SECTIONS_KEY}, and the sections that start shut open themselves for a selection
 * that has something in them (a shadow set, a tilt off zero), so a collapsed group never
 * hides a value the user can see on the canvas.
 *
 * NUMBERS ARE `numField` (components/num-field.ts). Every numeric value in the column -
 * geometry, size, radius, shadow offsets, tilt, durations - is the same control: drag its
 * label to scrub, arrow keys to step, type `+10` or `1920/2` into it. Sliders stay beside
 * opacity and corner radius, where a coarse sweep is the point, but the number is the
 * control that commits. One gesture is one `model.setField`, which is one undo step; the
 * slider mirrors the number and vice versa, and neither writes while the other is moving.
 *
 * ONE MOTION MODEL (2026-09-03, plans/179 M4). The Motion section's Appears control is
 * the single place a box says WHEN it arrives - with the slide, on a click, or at a
 * moment - and it writes the exclusive patch `lib/motion-model.ts` returns, so a box can
 * no longer carry a build step and a timeline start at once. Artboard gains the slide's
 * own transition to the next one (empty = follow the deck), and Object the two layer
 * flags. All three are drawn only where the MANIFEST declares the field (`declaredField`).
 *
 * MIXED IS A REAL STATE. Every cell in a paint group reads all the selected rows, and
 * shows "Mixed" rather than the first row's number when they disagree - because one
 * write goes to all of them, so a cell that shows 100 for a selection of 100 and 20
 * turns one arrow key into "set both to 99".
