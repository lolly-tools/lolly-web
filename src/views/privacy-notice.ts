/**
 * One-time privacy transparency notice (web/PWA shell only).
 *
 * Lolly stores only strictly-necessary, first-party data on the device - the
 * theme preference, a few UI prefs, an offline catalog cache, local-only vanity
 * counters (metrics.js - never transmitted), and the user's own tool documents
 * (IndexedDB via host.state). No cookies, no tracking, no analytics. Nothing
 * leaves the device unless the user starts a feature that needs the internet:
 * adding a Google Font in the brand editor (one consented fetch to Google's
 * font servers, then kept on-device) or playing the opt-in net-radio (SomaFM).
 * Both are disclosed with specifics in docs/privacy.md - keep that list and
 * this comment in sync with the code (SUSE assessment 2026-08, P1: an absolute
 * "nothing sent anywhere" claim is broader than the code supports).
 * Under the ePrivacy Directive (Art. 5(3)) storage that is
 * strictly necessary for the service the user asked for needs no consent - only
 * transparency. So this is a dismissible *notice*, not an accept/reject gate:
 * there is nothing non-essential to refuse.
 *
 * The dismissal flag itself is the textbook example of strictly-necessary
 * storage (it remembers that you closed the notice), so it persists in
 * localStorage without any consent of its own.
 *
 * The /info docs site is intentionally NOT covered by this - it sets no cookies
 * and writes only `theme` to localStorage for its dark-mode toggle, which is the
 * same strictly-necessary preference storage. See docs/privacy.md.
