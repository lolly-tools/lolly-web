/**
 * The two "Read text" call sites, as a source contract (WP-F, plans/124 section 9).
 *
 * Both OCR entry points - the catalogue asset modal (views/catalog.ts, `read-text`)
 * and the credential checker's image read (views/valid.ts, `readImageText`) - used
 * to `await host.ocr.run(...)` inline behind a disabled button, then write the
 * outcome in a `finally`. Two things were wrong with that, and this file exists so
 * neither comes back:
 *
 *   1. the run outlives its surface. A modal closes, ←/→ pages to another asset, a
 *      new file is dropped into the checker - and the `finally` wrote a label onto a
 *      DETACHED button, or worse, onto a DIFFERENT asset's button.
 *   2. the DURABLE half was lost with the surface. The catalogue read persists an
 *      AI-signals verdict onto the asset's meta (persistAiSignals); if the modal had
 *      closed, that write never happened and the read was simply thrown away.
 *
 * Now both enqueue a job (lib/ocr-job.ts) and every DOM write is guarded on the
 * surface still being live, while `persistAiSignals` runs either way. These are
 * source scans rather than mounted views on purpose: neither mountCatalog (5k
 * lines) nor mountValid is headless-mountable, and the property being protected is
 * structural. lib/ocr-job.test.ts covers the job behaviour itself.
 *
 * Run directly:  node --test shells/web/src/views/read-text-job.test.ts
