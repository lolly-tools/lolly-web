 * sequence-plan.ts - the PURE PLANNER behind deterministic sequence export
 * (Fable timeline, phase 3 section 0.0 "DESIGN REQUIREMENT added by the spike").
 *
 * Node cannot run WebCodecs, and Playwright's bundled Chromium has no proprietary
 * codecs. So anything that lives inside the compositor is browser-only and, in
 * practice, untested. This module holds the ENTIRE correctness surface of
 * a sequence render: stage parsing, activity windows, junction crossfade alpha,
 * `clipIn + (t − start) × speed` source mapping, the fixed-fps timestamp grid, the
 * silent-truncation guard, and error normalisation. It has no canvas, no WebCodecs, no
 * media element, and no mediabunny anywhere in it. The executor that consumes a plan
 * is a thin loop of `ctx.save()` / `drawImage` / `ctx.restore()` calls with no
 * decisions of its own.
 *
 * It reads a DOM node, but only ever with `getAttribute`, `style.*`, `querySelector`, and
 * `className` - everything jsdom implements. So the whole module runs headlessly
 * under `node:test`.
 *
 * PARITY IS THE POINT. The preview (views/sequence-clock.ts) and the exported file
 * must agree pixel for pixel. So:
 *   • the transition maths is IMPORTED from lib/transitions.ts, never re-derived;
 *   • the activity window is the same half-open `[start, start + dur)`;
 *   • enter/exit progress, the "whichever is further from rest wins" pick, and the
 *     open-ended-box exit suppression use the same readings as `transitionAt`;
 *   • the composed rotation is `authored + animation`, matching the CSS order
 *     `translate → rotate(authored) → rotate(anim) → scale` that the clock writes
 *     and the canvas order `translate → rotate(authored + anim) → scale` that the
 *     compositor issues.
 * tests/sequence-plan.test.ts checks that parity against the real sequence-clock
 * functions. Do not trust this comment instead of the test.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT imported: views/sequence-clock.ts. This is bridge code. The
 * bridge does not depend on the views layer (no bridge module does today), and the
 * clock also loads the lottie mount and the seek queue. The overlap is about 40 lines of
 * attribute reading, and the test file pins the two implementations together.

 * Re-anchor a timed FRAME-PAGE scene layer to the OUTPUT viewport (ISSUE 1).

 * A "Design" frames slideshow places its pages side by side on the pasteboard. So a
 * page's authored `left`/`top` (the rect readLayer read) puts slides 2..N off the
 * one-slide-wide output canvas: the "only slide 1 shows" bug. For a frameScene layer
 * this rewrites the DRAW rect to `(0, 0, nativeW, nativeH)`, where nativeW/nativeH are
 * the output's pre-scale native size (a frame's own size; see renderSequence's
 * frames-mode branch). `drawItem` then translates to the viewport centre and draws the
 * plate over the full `outW × outH`. So each slide fills its window regardless of the
 * frame's spatial x/y.
 *
 * PURE and compositor-only: it returns a COPY with a new rect and leaves the committed
 * model (the frame's real x/y, its [data-pdf-page] export page) untouched. So the
 * carousel still lays out side by side in the editor and still exports as multi-page
 * PDF. A non-frameScene layer (every object-clip `.lolly-box`) is returned unchanged.
