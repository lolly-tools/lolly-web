/**
 * TokensAPI - design tokens for the host UI and token-aware tools.
 *
 * The canonical brand tokens live in the catalog as a `tokens`-type asset (a
 * DTCG document). Discovery is brand-agnostic: the bridge takes the first
 * `type: 'tokens'` asset that is not a published VERSION of another one - the
 * same rule the MCP server's tokens resource and the CLI apply (see
 * pickHeadAssetId, plans/97 section 6a) - rather than pinning a brand-specific id, so a
 * different brand profile's catalog supplies its own tokens with no shell
 * change. The document is handed to engine/src/tokens.js for resolution - so the
 * colour picker can source its swatches from tokens, brand-bound input values can
 * resolve their references, and a token-aware tool can read the whole tree.
 *
 * Versioning (plans/97 section 6a) is layered on top and costs an unversioned install
 * nothing: the head asset IS the edit head, and `forVersion(slug)` opens a
 * read-only surface over a published sibling `<headId>/<slug>`.
 *
 * THE DEFAULT READS ARE THE RENDER SURFACE, not the head. `get`/`colors`/
 * `resolve`/`themes` answer for whatever the section 6a ladder lands on - the `?designv=`
 * override on the current route, else the active version, else the head - because
 * every render on this shell reads them through `host.tokens`: the tool canvas's
 * brand vars, the picker swatches, the engine's token-bound inputs, the export
 * palette. Resolving the ladder at each of those sites instead would be a rule
 * some future call site forgets, and the shell would paint one design system
 * while the tools it frames painted another. `raw()` is the exception and stays
 * the HEAD: it is the document the studio edits and re-installs, and handing an
 * editor a frozen version to write back over the head would destroy the head.
 * With nothing published the ladder answers `latest` and the render surface reads
 * the head document, so an unversioned install resolves exactly as it always did.
 *
 * Loading is offline-safe and degrades gracefully. Discovery prefers the
 * synced asset metadata in IndexedDB (the service worker deliberately BYPASSES
 * /catalog/, so network fetches there fail offline), falling back to a fetch
 * of the catalog index for a cold first load; the document itself prefers the
 * core-prefetched blob in IndexedDB (cached at boot by catalog/sync.js) over a
 * direct fetch of the asset's file. If nothing resolves, an empty set is
 * returned - the picker quietly falls back to its built-in palette - and
 * nothing is memoised, so every subsequent call retries. A brand-ingest flow
 * that installs new tokens must call bust() so the next read re-discovers - 
 * installUserTokens (below) is the canonical write path: it stores the user's
 * own DTCG doc as the `user/tokens/brand` asset, which discovery returns ahead
 * of any catalog tokens (assets._findMetaByType checks the user store first).
 *
 * This is an *additive* v1 capability (HostV1.tokens?), like net/text - a shell
 * that doesn't provide it just doesn't offer token-driven swatches.
