/**
 * sequence-dom.ts - putting a timed composition's LIVE DOM at a given time.
 *
 * The single implementation of the phase-1 attribute contract as applied to real
 * elements: which `.lolly-box` is on screen at `t`, and what transform/opacity an
 * enter/exit transition composes on top of that box's AUTHORED inline styles. Two
 * very different callers need exactly this and must never disagree:
 *
 *   • views/sequence-clock.ts - the preview playhead (scrub + play), which imports
 *     everything below rather than owning it. This module was carved OUT of the
 *     clock; the clock re-exports the whole surface, so its public API is unchanged.
 *   • bridge/export.ts renderLive - "Record live" films the real DOM in real time,
 *     and nothing else advances a sequence stage while it does, so the capture has
 *     to drive the playhead itself (`driveSequenceTime`). Without it a live take is
 *     one held frame.
 *
 * The same applier also backs the planned contact-sheet export (`cuts=N`), which
 * walks t across the sequence snapshotting the DOM - hence the general session API
 * rather than anything capture-shaped.
 *
 * NOT the same thing as sequence-plan.ts. That module resolves a layer's state for
 * the CANVAS compositor (a draw plan of numbers, no DOM writes); this one mutates
 * live elements. The two are pinned to each other by tests/sequence-plan.test.ts,
 * which asserts the numeric parity rather than trusting a comment.
 *
 * EVERY WRITE IS REVERSIBLE. One class and SIX inline properties per box - 
 * `transform`, `opacity`, and (only on a stage that authors depth, plans/104)
 * `filter`, `z-index`, `width` and `height` - with the authored values captured before
 * the first write and handed back verbatim on restore (declaration-identical, not
 * byte-identical: writing through CSSStyleDeclaration re-serialises the whole `style`
 * attribute). That list is the WHOLE per-frame surface; anything that photographs a
 * live stage - sequence-render's plate capture, clip-thumbs' borrow, sequence-cuts, and
 * this module's own `driveSequenceTime` - neutralises exactly these, through the
 * read/restore seam below, so a new one arriving here is a change to their contract
 * too.
 *
 * `width`/`height` are THE ONE DELIBERATE EXCEPTION to "the applier never writes
 * layout" (plans/104 section 5.2, the P1 reversal). Every other property here is composited:
 * it changes what the box looks like without changing what the box IS, so a frame
 * costs no reflow. A keyed `w`/`h` costs one, on purpose - text REWRAPS, a border stays
 * one pixel wide, a flex row re-distributes. That is the entire reason the channel
 * exists, and it is why the canvas compositor cannot fake it with a stretched plate and
 * re-photographs a sized layer per frame instead (parity beats speed). The cost is
 * bounded by the same gate as the rest of depth: with no `data-t-kf` mentioning `w`
 * or `h`, `fold.sized` is false everywhere, the two slots stay null and no layout write
 * is ever issued.
 *
 * Composition, not clobbering: a box carries authored inline styles from the tool
 * hook - `transform:rotate(-4deg)`, `opacity:0.8`. An entrance animation adds to
 * those, never replaces them:
 *
 *     translate(dx,dy)  <authored...>  rotate(animRot)  scale(sc)
 *
 * which multiplies out to the same matrix order the video compositor uses
 * (`translate -> rotate(authored+anim) -> scale`), so a scrubbed preview, a live
 * take and a composited render agree. The transition maths itself is IMPORTED from
 * lib/transitions.ts - never re-derived here.
 *
 * DEPTH RIDES THE SAME RULE (plans/104). Keyframe evaluation and the camera
 * projection come from the engine (`evaluateKf`, `projectLayer`, `dofBlur`), folded
 * into per-layer numbers by ONE adapter - `foldKfPose` in sequence-plan.ts - that
 * this module and the canvas planner both call. Neither side owns a formula, so
 * neither side can drift from the other; tests/sequence-plan.test.ts asserts it.
 * A document with no `data-t-z` and no `data-t-kf` never reaches any of it.

// ── the live-writer registry (the export-time read/restore seam) ────────────
//
// THE PROBLEM (plans/104 section 6 point 0, the review's top finding, found twice).
// `renderSequence` parses and PHOTOGRAPHS the live artboard - the same artboard the
// preview clock has been writing on. Every read it takes is an authored read:
// `readLayer` takes the box's rotation off `style.transform`, its opacity off
// `style.opacity`, its blur off `style.filter` (sequence-plan.ts:225-231). Before
// plans/104 those writes were brief transition windows, so an export taken mid-fade
// was a little wrong in a way nobody had measured. Under keyframes nearly every t has
// a composed transform, opacity and filter on nearly every box, and the failure is
// total: authored geometry read PRE-PROJECTED and then projected again, a keyframed
// blur baked into the plate AND applied again by the executor. The playhead can be
// parked anywhere when an export starts, which is what makes this a correctness bug
// rather than a nicety.
//
// THE FIX, and why it is a registry. The authored values are not on the DOM - that is
// the whole point of the AuthoredStore - and the exporter is three modules away from
// the clock that holds them. So every live writer (the preview clock, each
// `createSequenceTime` session) announces itself here, and anything that READS or
// PHOTOGRAPHS the stage asks the registry to make the DOM authored again first:
//
//   • `withAuthoredDom(root, fn)` - the whole-export scope. Every writer over `root`
//     stands down (its writes handed back) AND STAYS DOWN for the duration, because an
//     rAF tick landing mid-export would otherwise re-pose the stage between two plate
//     shots. Balanced, so nested scopes compose; the writers re-assert on the way out.
//     Used by `renderSequence` (the whole film) and by `renderSequenceCuts` (all N
//     stills of a contact sheet) - a reader that opens its OWN session on the same
//     root needs it as much as a photographer does, because that session's
//     AuthoredStore captures whatever is on the element the first time it touches it.
//   • `beginAuthoredDom(root)` - the same scope opened and closed by hand, for a
//     reader whose span is not one function call: `driveSequenceTime`'s live take runs
//     between `start()` and `stop()` on somebody else's timer.
//   • `authoredStyleOf(el)` - the non-mutating read, for a photographer that can
//     neutralise on its own CLONE instead (clip-thumbs' dom-to-image `style` override).
//     Nothing on the live stage moves, so a thumbnail shot cannot flicker the editor.
//   • `borrowAuthoredPose(el)` - one element restored in place, for a reader that walks
//     the LIVE subtree and has no clone to neutralise (the vector twin).
//
// A writer that has written nothing costs every one of these exactly one Set iteration
// over an empty-or-tiny registry: a document with no clock (a CLI render, a headless
// test, an export of a stage nobody ever played) takes the identical path it took
// before this existed.

 * enumerate different scenes (plans/104 P1 review, HIGH 1):
 *
 *  • `[data-t-start]` - anything timed. NOT restricted to `.lolly-box`, so a sequenced
 *    `[data-pdf-page]` frame page (frames-as-scenes) is gated by the exact same pass,
 *    and its `.seq-off` is the same class sequence-render.ts strips before it
 *    photographs a frame. A frames doc has no `[data-sequence]` stage, so
 *    `sequenceStageOf` falls back to `root` and still finds the pages.
 *  • `[data-t-z]` / `[data-t-kf]` - SCENERY that is lifted or animated. The hooks emit
 *    these for a timed and an untimed box alike ("a scenery box on a sequence stage is
 *    visible throughout and can still be lifted off the surface or animated"), while
 *    the planner enumerates every `.lolly-box` regardless of timing. Without them a
 *    scenery box's z and its whole keyframe track were live in the export and inert in
 *    the preview.
 *  • `[data-cam]` - the camera MARKER, mapped to the box that carries its pose. section 5.4's
 *    headline "Always on" scene camera is untimed by construction, so it has no
 *    `data-t-start` and the applier could not see the one element whose whole job is to
 *    move everything else: the camera-pan drag, the wheel dolly and all five presets
 *    committed to the model and then did nothing visible in the editor. A camera at the
 *    DEFAULT pose carries neither `data-t-z` nor `data-t-kf` and still has to be here,
 *    because cuts resolve to the LATEST camera covering `t` - a default one later in
 *    DOM order legitimately cuts an earlier moving one back to rest.
 *
 * Plus, once a camera exists at all, the stage's BACKGROUND PLANE: its own children
 * that are not layers. That is exactly the residue `sequence-render.ts` photographs
 * into the bg plate (it hides every `.lolly-box` and timed frame page and shoots what
 * is left - the connector layer, for one), and section 5.5 requires BOTH paths to project it,
 * or a pan slides every layer across frozen wallpaper. Gated on a camera being present
 * because without one nothing can move the plane, so a camera-less document - every
 * document written before this - is not given one extra element to walk.
