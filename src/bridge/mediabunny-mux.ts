/**
 * mediabunny-backed muxer - the write half of the WebCodecs video/audio export.
 *
 * Replaces the deprecated mp4-muxer / webm-muxer. Their author retired both in
 * favour of mediabunny, which supersedes them: one library (already loaded on the
 * decode side, so a smaller net footprint here), an actively-maintained MP4/WebM
 * writer, and more formats. The encode paths are otherwise UNCHANGED - they still
 * drive the WebCodecs VideoEncoder / AudioEncoder themselves and hand us the
 * resulting EncodedVideo/AudioChunks; this module only turns those chunks into a
 * finished container.
 *
 * ── The one shape change ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The old muxers exposed a SYNCHRONOUS addVideoChunk / addAudioChunk / finalize;
 * mediabunny's Output is async end-to-end (it awaits writer + encoder
 * backpressure). To keep the callers' shape, chunks are converted to mediabunny
 * EncodedPackets and BUFFERED synchronously on add (their bytes are copied out
 * there and then), and the whole Output is built and written at finalize - the
 * one method that had to become async.
 *
 * finalize() replays the buffered packets in a single canonical order (ascending
 * presentation timestamp, video winning a tie), so a given render always produces
 * the same bytes regardless of the order the two encoders' output callbacks
 * happened to fire in. Per-track order is each encoder's own emit order (decode
 * order; none of these codecs produce B-frames), so only the cross-stream
 * interleave is decided here - and it is decided identically every run. Memory is
 * unchanged from before: mp4-muxer's `fastStart: 'in-memory'` and webm-muxer both
 * already accumulated the whole encoded stream.
 *
 * A track is created only if it actually received packets, so a declared-but-empty
 * audio track (switched on, never fed) is dropped rather than written as a silent
 * stream.
 *
 * mediabunny is `import()`ed lazily (as the old muxers were), so it never enters
 * the preload bundle - it loads only when someone exports.
