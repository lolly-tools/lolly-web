 *
 * Idempotent and safe to call concurrently: the in-flight promise is cached, so
 * N runtimes mounting at once share one import. Every path that mounts a tool
 * MUST await this first; do not call it directly - go through
 * lib/mount-runtime.ts's createToolRuntime(), which is the enforced chokepoint.
 *
 * Failure is non-fatal by design: both APIs are OPTIONAL in the v1 contract and
 * tools feature-detect them, so a failed import degrades a colour/vector tool to
 * its own fallback rather than blocking the mount.
