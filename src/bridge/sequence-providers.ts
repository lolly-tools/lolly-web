 * sequence-providers.ts - frame + audio sources for the sequence compositor
 * (Fable timeline, phase 3 section 2.2).
 *
 * The compositor asks one question per clip per output frame: paint the pixels
 * of THIS source at THIS source time into THIS rectangle. It asks one question
 * per clip per export: hand me the PCM for this span. Everything behind those
 * two questions (a WebCodecs decode pipeline, a hidden <video> being seeked, a
 * container demuxer) lives in this file and nowhere else.
 *
 * WHY THE INTERFACES ARE SHAPED LIKE THIS
 *
 * `FrameProvider` is DRAW-AND-RELEASE, not "give me an image source". The spike
 * (plans/54-fable-timeline-phase-3.md section 0.0 rule 3) found that mediabunny's
 * `VideoSample` is already the draw wrapper: `sample.draw(ctx, dx, dy, dw, dh)`
 * applies the container's rotation metadata into the destination rect for us.
 * `toCanvasImageSource()` may auto-close in the next microtask, and
 * `toVideoFrame()` mints a second object with its own lifetime. Handing a
 * `CanvasImageSource` to the caller would hand out a resource the caller cannot
 * close correctly. So the provider owns the sample from decode to close, and the
 * caller only ever supplies a context and a rect.
 *
 * `ClipAudio.pcm()` returns PCM already trimmed to the exact sample offsets.
 * `AudioBufferSink.buffers(a, b)` respects its range only to packet granularity
 * (AAC = 1024 frames = 21.33 ms): it includes the packet straddling `a` and the
 * one straddling `b` (spike rule 6). A caller that just concatenated what the
 * sink yields would give every clip up to 21 ms of its neighbour's audio, heard
 * as a click at every cut. The trim happens here, once, in a pure function, so
 * it is unit-testable without a decoder.
 *
 * RESOURCE DISCIPLINE
 *
 * At most `MAX_IN_FLIGHT` (2) decoded samples are held at any instant, and each
 * one closes in the same tick as its draw. mediabunny already caps its own
 * decode queue at 8, and the spike could not reproduce a hardware-decoder stall
 * at any N. So this cap is a MEMORY policy, not a decoder-count limit: the JS
 * heap moved 1.6 MB while roughly 2.8 GB of frame data was nominally held, so no
 * JS instrument can see the real ceiling. `stats()` exposes the in-flight count
 * because it is the only observable the tests have.
 *
 * NEVER HANGS. Every await in this file runs inside `withTimeout`, because a
 * stalled decoder looks the same as a slow one, and a hung export is worse than
 * a failed one. Every failure is normalised through the one `toCodedError` in
 * ./sequence-plan.ts (spike rule 8: failures arrive as mediabunny typed errors,
 * raw WebCodecs `DOMException`s, and plain `Error`s).
 *
 * TRUNCATION IS SILENT (spike rule 7): a half-written container decodes a
 * clean, short iteration with no error at all. This module cannot decide what
 * to do about that - the renderer owns the fail-closed policy - so it exposes
 * the evidence instead: `stats().decoded`, `stats().missed` and
 * `stats().lastSourceSec` against `durationSec()`.
 *
 * BUNDLE SIZE. mediabunny is `import()`ed lazily, and only the container
 * singletons we actually accept are pulled in, never `ALL_FORMATS`. The video
 * and audio paths register DIFFERENT sets (see VIDEO_CONTAINERS /
 * AUDIO_CONTAINERS): registering only the video four here is what silently
 * broke every catalog music bed, because Lolly's audio ships as Ogg/Opus and
 * MP3. A static import would cost the preload entry +352 kB (+89 kB gzip)
 * versus +0.14 kB lazy. `sequence-providers.test.ts` has a source guard that
 * fails the build if either rule is broken by an innocent-looking editor
 * auto-import.
 *
 * NOT EVERY SOURCE IS A FILE. An audio box may carry a `zzfxm:<seed>[:<style>]`
 * ref instead of an asset url: a procedural track, synthesised here from the
 * engine's seeded composer. It arrives through the same `createClipAudio` and
 * satisfies the same `ClipAudio`, so the mix cannot tell the difference. See the
 * "procedural audio" section at the foot of this file for the grammar and for
 * why it reports a duration of 0. A TRACKER MODULE (.mod/.xm/.it/.s3m/.stm/.mtm)
 * is the same kind of thing from the other direction: a real file, but a score
 * rather than an encoded stream, which no demuxer can read. It arrives through
 * the same door: see the "tracker modules" section, also at the foot of this
 * file.
 *
 * BROWSER-ONLY, AND WHAT ISN'T. The decode/draw path needs WebCodecs and a real
 * canvas context, so it can only be proven in the Playwright tier. Everything
 * that decides what to do - the provider pick ladder, the primed-grid matcher,
 * the PCM window trim/resample, the in-flight accounting, error normalisation,
 * dispose idempotency - is injectable and covered headlessly.

// ── tracker modules: .mod/.xm/.it/.s3m/.stm/.mtm ────────────────────────────
//
// A tracker module is a SCORE: patterns of notes plus the instrument samples
// they play. There is no encoded audio stream in the file, and no demuxer
// reads one. mediabunny returns nothing for it, which is exactly how an audio
// box holding a module came out silent, with the export log saying only that
// the container was unreadable. libopenmpt (lib/mod-render.ts, a vendored WASM
// worker) is the one thing here that can render one, and it is already the
// path the export bar's music bed uses for a 'mod'-format track
// (views/tool-actions.ts). So this is a wiring job, not a new capability.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT: a second decode pipeline. The rendered PCM goes through the
// same `assemblePcmWindow` a decoded file and a zzfxm song go through, so the
// trim, the resample to the mix rate and the window semantics are literally
// the same code.
//
// HOW ONE IS RECOGNISED: `isModuleUrl` / `sniffTrackerModule`, imported from
// the clock so the preview cannot disagree. See that file's "tracker modules"
// section for why the extension alone is not enough (an upload is a `blob:`
// url), and why the AssetRef `format` field, which would be the honest signal,
// does not survive as far as here.
//
// WHY `renderMod` AND NOT `modUrlToWavBlobUrl`: the WAV round trip exists for
// the URL-driven muxer, which can only be handed a url. Here the caller wants
// samples, and `renderMod` already returns exactly the `{left, right,
// sampleRate}` the zzfxm path returns. Taking the WAV detour would mean
// encoding a RIFF header, minting a blob url, re-fetching it and demuxing it
// back to the same floats. (WAVE is registered in AUDIO_CONTAINERS, so that
// route would work; it is simply two conversions and a revoke-or-leak worse
// than not doing it.)

// ── procedural audio: the `zzfxm:` scheme ───────────────────────────────────
//
// A sequence needs a music bed that is OFFLINE, REPRODUCIBLE and LICENCE-FREE.
// A catalog loop is none of those three: it is an on-demand fetch, it only
// exists in a brand pack that shipped it, and it carries whatever licence the
// track came with. So a box may instead carry a procedural asset ref, an id
// rather than a file, and this module synthesises the audio from it.
//
// THE GRAMMAR (the whole contract, deliberately tiny):
//
//     zzfxm:<seed>            e.g. zzfxm:20260726
//     zzfxm:<seed>:<style>    e.g. zzfxm:20260726:lofi
//
//   • `<seed>` is 1-10 DECIMAL DIGITS, read as a uint32. No sign, no `0x`, no
//     decimal point, no whitespace. Anything else is not a procedural ref at
//     all, so it can never be confused with a `blob:`/`data:`/`https:` url.
//   • `<style>` is optional and, when present, one of the engine's archetype
//     names. An unrecognised style is IGNORED (the seed picks the archetype,
//     as if the style had been omitted) instead of failing the bed: a typo in
//     a shared link should still play music. It is still deterministic; the
//     same unrecognised style always yields the same song.
//   • Nothing else is encoded. In particular NOT the length: the same ref is a
//     20-second bed under a 20-second sequence and a 90-second bed under a
//     90-second one, which is what makes the ref survive editing.
//
// WHY `durationSec()` RETURNS 0. A synthesised source has no intrinsic length;
// it is composed to fit. The mix in sequence-render.ts already handles that
// case: `srcDur > 0 ? min(from + durMs, srcDur) : from + durMs`, i.e. a source
// that declines to state a duration is asked for exactly the window the box
// occupies. That is exactly the semantics wanted here, so the procedural clip
// reports 0 and the mix needs no change at all.
//
// DETERMINISM IS THE POINT, AND HERE IS EXACTLY HOW FAR IT GOES. Every value
// in the SPEC comes from `mulberry32(seed)` (integer-only) or from the target
// length. There is no `Math.random`, no `Date`, no `performance.now`, no
// locale, no Map/Set iteration order and no platform read anywhere on that
// path. So the composed song (the notes, the tempo, the instruments, the
// arrangement) is identical everywhere, always.
//
// The RENDER is one step weaker, and the difference is worth stating rather
// than overclaiming: `zzfxG`'s sample loop uses `Math.sin`/`Math.cos`/`Math.tan`
// and `**`, whose results ECMA-262 permits an implementation to approximate.
// V8, JSC and SpiderMonkey are not guaranteed bit-identical for those. So the
// honest claim is: byte-identical PCM for the same ref plus target length on a
// GIVEN engine (which is what the "export twice, get the same bed" promise
// actually needs), and a perceptually identical song everywhere else. The
// target length is quantised (below) so a totalMs wobbling by a millisecond
// between two renders cannot recompose the song.

// header for why it is alone in a module. Re-exported here so this stays the
