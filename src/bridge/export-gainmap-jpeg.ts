/**
 * HDR JPEG as an ISO 21496-1 gain-map file - Phase B2 of
 * plans/61-deeprichpixels.md (§4.2, §6 B, §10 item 2), and the sibling of
 * `export-hdr-png.ts`.
 *
 * Before this module, `?hdr=1&format=jpeg` ran the canvas through the engine's
 * legacy byte path (`hdrBoostToPQ`: 8-bit in, 8-bit PQ code values out) and
 * tagged the result with a Rec.2100-PQ ICC profile. Two defects in one file:
 * PQ quantised to 8 bits bands in the shadows (plan §1's sharpest recorded
 * defect), and a PQ-tagged JPEG shown by any decoder that ignores the profile - 
 * which is most of them - is a washed-out, wrongly-lit picture, because PQ code
 * values interpreted as sRGB are simply the wrong numbers. The SDR "fallback"
 * of the old path was not a fallback at all.
 *
 * A gain-map JPEG inverts that. The file IS an ordinary SDR JPEG; the HDR lives
 * in a second, appended image saying how much brighter each pixel gets, plus
 * metadata saying how to apply it. Chromium, Safari/macOS/iOS and Android 15
 * render it as real HDR; everything else renders the SDR base byte for byte.
 * It is the only HDR still-image output with that property today.
 *
 *   canvas RGBA8 -> (imprint / durable marks, in the DELIVERED SDR space)
 *                -> encodeJpeg            == the base image, and the fallback
 *                -> fromU8Srgb            (linear f32)
 *                -> hdrViewTransform      (brand boost, Rec.2020 linear, unbounded)
 *                -> computeGainMap        (log2(HDR/SDR), one luminance channel)
 *                -> encodeJpeg (grey)     == the gain-map image
 *                -> assembleGainMapJpeg   (MPF + dual XMP/ISO metadata)
 *
 * ─── One rasterisation, and why the two images are pixel-aligned ─────────────
 * `hdrViewTransform` derives the HDR rendition FROM the SDR frame, so the pair
 * is aligned by construction - there is no second render, no re-layout, and no
 * chance of a half-pixel drift between base and map. This is also what plan §10
 * means by depth-follows-provenance on this path: the map's values come from
 * the float view transform, never from an upsampled 8-bit intermediate.
 *
 * ─── depth= interaction ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `depth=8` OPTS OUT to the legacy PQ path (the gate lives in `renderRaster`),
 * because unlike the PNG case there is a coherent 8-bit answer here and a caller
 * asking for one may have a reason. Everything else - 16/float/auto/absent - 
 * takes this path; `float` is noted and satisfied by the map, since JPEG has no
 * deep sample format of its own.
 *
 * ─── What the marks apply to ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `imprint` and `durable` are applied to the SDR pixels BEFORE the base is
 * encoded, so the mark lives in the delivered base image - the one every viewer
 * and every detector actually sees. The gain map is then computed from the
 * MARKED pixels, so the HDR rendition a gain-map-aware viewer reconstructs is
 * the marked image boosted, not a different picture. (The legacy path marked
 * after the PQ transform for the same reason: marks belong in the delivered
 * space.)
 *
 * DOM-free on purpose, exactly like `export-hdr-png.ts`: pixels in, bytes out,
 * with the one genuinely DOM-bound step - JPEG encoding - injected as
 * `encodeJpeg`. That is what lets the whole seam be driven under node:test with
 * real JPEG fixtures and no canvas (export-gainmap-jpeg.test.ts).
