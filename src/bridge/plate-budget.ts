/**
 * THE PLATE BUDGET — how much memory a sequence export may spend on plates, and what
 * it gives back when it cannot afford what the camera asked for (plan 104 §5.5).
 *
 * Layers are rasterised ONCE, before the frame loop, and re-drawn every frame. That is
 * cheap while every plate is shot at the export scale S. Depth changes the arithmetic:
 * a layer flown toward the camera is magnified by `eff`, and a plate shot at S and then
 * blown up by eff is a soft plate, so §5.5 shoots it at `S·eff` instead. `eff` is
 * capped at KF_EFF_MAX = 10 by the behind-camera guard, and a six-layer 1080p job at
 * eff 2.5 is already ~311 MB of plates — doubled while the worker path has both the
 * originals and their transferred copies alive. Fly-pasts are EXPECTED to hit the cap.
 * That path is designed, not exceptional.
 *
 * So: a budget, and one degradation knob.
 *
 *   budget      = min(8, deviceMemory ?? 4)/8 × 512 MB   (the `maxVideoFrames`
 *                 deviceMemory-scaling precedent, sequence-render.ts)
 *   long side   ≤ 4096 px below 8 GB, 8192 px at or above it — Safari's canvas-area
 *                 caps are real, and `rasterBox`'s bare catch nulls a refused plate
 *                 SILENTLY, which is the worst possible way to find out
 *   over budget → ONE λ = sqrt(budget / need), applied to every layer's eff, floored
 *                 at 1, and ONE warn line naming the clamp
 *   pad         — the OTHER multiplier on plate size (§5.5's capture margin for a
 *                 blur/shadow spill). It gets its own cap against the same long side,
 *                 because eff floors at 1 and λ only scales eff: without one, a big
 *                 authored blur grows a plate ~90× with nothing able to take it back
 *
 * TWO RULES MAKE THIS SAFE TO SHIP AT P0, WHERE THERE IS NO CAMERA AND EVERY eff IS 1.
 *
 *  1. The floor is TODAY'S QUALITY. λ and the long-side cap only ever scale the eff
 *     multiplier, never below 1 — so a document that asked for no extra resolution
 *     cannot have resolution taken away, and its plates are the bytes they always were.
 *  2. Nothing is CLAMPED and nothing is LOGGED unless some layer actually asked for
 *     extra. A 4× export of a 4000 px board is over the long-side cap at eff 1 and must
 *     stay exactly as it is; warning about a clamp that did not happen is how a
 *     no-silent-caps rule turns into noise nobody reads.
 *
 * Pure arithmetic, no DOM, no canvas — so `plate-budget.test.ts` can drive it with
 * synthetic eff values that P0 cannot produce and P1 will.
