 * `host.viz` — what a tool can ask about the MilkDrop visualizer.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a mounting API. A tool is data: it has no element to hand us and no
 * business holding a WebGL context, so the surface it actually renders is a
 * `[data-lolly-viz]` placeholder that lib/viz-tool-mount.ts enhances after each paint.
 * What a tool genuinely can't work out for itself is (a) whether this shell can run a
 * visualizer at all, so it can choose a fallback style, and (b) WHO WROTE the preset it
 * is about to show — which is the whole point of shipping the artist presets. Both are
 * answered here.
 *
 * Progressive enhancement, not a capability: `isAvailable()` false (no WebGL2, a
 * headless CLI render) means the tool draws its ordinary canvas style, never that it
 * refuses to render.
