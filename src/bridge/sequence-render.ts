 * sequence-render.ts - the EXECUTOR + ORCHESTRATOR for deterministic sequence
 * export (Fable timeline, phase 3 §2.5).
 *
 * The split this module lives on is the whole point of the phase-3 design (spike
 * §0.0, "DESIGN REQUIREMENT"):
 *
 *   sequence-plan.ts      decides WHAT is on screen at time t and where its media
 *                         is seeked to - pure, DOM-only-for-reading, node-testable.
 *   sequence-providers.ts turns one clip into pixels/PCM at a source time - 
 *                         mediabunny + WebCodecs live ONLY behind that seam.
 *   sequence-render.worker.ts  the DOM-FREE executor: `drawItem`, the frame loop,
 *                         the provider lifecycle and the truncation reconciliation
 *                         (phase 4 Track B) - plus the Worker entry that runs it.
 *   THIS FILE             reads the LIVE DOM (stage parse, dom-to-image rasters,
 *                         the lottie player), mixes the audio graph, decides which
 *                         thread executes, and owns every output container.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO activity, alpha, crossfade or source-time arithmetic in
 * here. If a question is "should this be visible / how faded / which frame of the
 * source", it belongs in the planner and is already answered by the PlanItem. What
 * is left here is genuinely browser-only: dom-to-image, lottie-web, the
 * OfflineAudioContext, MediaRecorder and the container writers.
 *
 * WORKER OFFLOAD (phase 4 Track B), and the SPLIT RULE. `renderSequence` builds a
 * fully serialisable `SeqJob` - the layers minus their elements, the static
 * rasters, the clip bytes, the mixed PCM - and hands it to ONE executor,
 * `runSequenceJob`. Which thread that executor runs on is the only difference
 * between the two paths, so determinism is structural rather than asserted:
 *
 *   • no lottie layer  ⇒ the whole frame loop (decode, composite, encode, mux)
 *     runs in the Worker and the main thread only awaits the result;
 *   • a lottie layer   ⇒ HYBRID. lottie-web cannot run in a worker, so the worker
 *     asks the main thread for that layer's raster per frame ('need-live') and
 *     blocks on the answer, at most ONE request outstanding;
 *   • gif / apng / the MediaRecorder fallback, or any missing capability
 *     (`supportsWorkerSequenceRender()`), ⇒ the executor runs in-thread, exactly
 *     as it did before this change.
 *
 * The worker path is OPT-IN behind the same `lolly.workerEncode` flag that gates
 * bridge/video-encode.ts, and any non-coded worker failure falls back to a full
 * in-thread render (the static rasters are kept as canvases precisely so that
 * retry costs nothing).
 *
 * MEMORY. The mp4/webm path holds O(1) DECODED frames in duration: one canvas, at
 * most two decoded samples per open provider (the providers' own ledger enforces
 * that), and at most HIGH_WATER+1 VideoFrames inside the streaming mux. That is why
 * `maxVideoFrames()` - which exists purely because the old path buffered an
 * ImageBitmap per frame - is NOT applied to it. It is NOT O(1) overall: both muxers
 * accumulate the ENCODED stream (mp4-muxer's `fastStart:'in-memory'` by design,
 * webm-muxer's `_videoChunkQueue` until an audio chunk with a ≥ timestamp drains
 * it), so peak memory is O(duration × bitrate) in compressed bytes - ~45 MB for a
 * ten-minute 1080p clip, three orders of magnitude below the frame buffering this
 * path replaced. gif/apng buffer every frame as pixels, so they keep the cap; so
 * does the MediaRecorder fallback, which buffers an ImageBitmap per frame.
 *
 * WHAT IS DUPLICATED FROM export.ts, AND WHY. `pickWebCodecsVideo`,
 * `pickWebCodecsAudio`, `withVideoMeta`, `manualCaptureStream`, `recorderOpts`,
 * `maxVideoFrames`, `swapBlobUrls`, `getDomToImage`, the `rasterBox` technique and
 * `connectMusic`'s gain envelope are all module-private in bridge/export.ts. This
 * phase's brief allowed exactly three edits to that file (the stage sniff, the
 * dispatch branch, the snapshotMotion guard) - exporting nine more symbols is not
 * one of them - so they are reproduced here, each marked `// from export.ts:<name>`
 * and kept behaviourally identical. THIS IS A REPORTED DEBT: the right end state is
 * a shared bridge/video-shared.ts that both files import. See the build report.

 *
 * The margin, derived rather than guessed. At z = 0 the plane maps to a rect of
 * `W·eff × H·eff` centred at `(W/2 − camX·eff, H/2 − camY·eff)`, and a native-px margin
 * of `pad` covers `pad·eff` of projected space, so covering the viewport on both sides
 * of an axis needs
 *
 *     pad ≥ |camX| + (W/2)·(1/eff − 1)         (and likewise camY / H)
 *
 * - the pan term plus the pull-back term, since `eff < 1` (the camera moved AWAY) is
 * what shrinks the plane inside the frame and opens a gap at every edge at once. Taken
 * as the window maximum over the SAME grid the frame loop walks, exactly as `maxEff` is.

   * **P2a - the CAPTURE TIER** (plans/104 §6.4, verbatim: "its own loop
   * `createSequenceTime(root).apply(grid[i])` per frame → dom-to-image capture → the
   * existing streaming mux").
   *
   * The other renderer in this file plans a frame and DRAWS it; this one poses the
   * live artboard and PHOTOGRAPHS it. Everything downstream of the picture - the
   * encoder pick, the streaming muxer, the gif/apng sinks, the audio mix, the
   * provenance tags - is the same machinery, which is the point: the tilt tier changes
   * where pixels come from and nothing else about what an export is.
   *
   * Why it has to be a photograph. A tilted camera's projection is a homography, and
   * `CanvasRenderingContext2D.setTransform` takes six numbers - an affine map. There
   * is no approximation of a perspective divide in that vocabulary, only a wrong
   * picture. The browser, meanwhile, has done this since CSS transforms shipped: the
   * DOM applier writes the engine's own matrix as a per-element `matrix3d` (see
   * `composeTransform`), so by the time this loop takes its shot the artboard already
   * IS the composite, tilt and all. Capturing it is the shortest correct path, and it
   * makes "the video reflects the preview" true by construction rather than by parity
   * testing.
   *
   * NOT `createFrameSource`. That drives animation clocks, not the sequence session
   * (§6.4 says so explicitly): its `frame(t)` knows nothing about `.seq-off`, the
   * per-frame `filter`/`z-index` surface or the camera. This loop drives the same
   * `createSequenceTime` session the contact sheet uses, which is the one apply site
   * every still and every preview already goes through.
   *
   * VIDEO REFUSES, visibly (§6.4). dom-to-image serialises the DOM into an SVG
   * `<foreignObject>`, and a `<video>` element does not survive that - the freeze would
   * bake one frame of it under the whole move, silently. Hybrid compositing (draw the
   * decoded frames, then the captured chrome over them) is P2b's job with the GPU
   * compositor; until then this says no with a reason.
   *
   * The static-chrome fast path self-declines here for a reason worth stating: the
   * session writes inline styles on every frame, which raises MutationObserver records,
   * so every frame pays a full dom-to-image serialisation. That is the price §6.4 named
   * in advance, and it is why the log below quotes an estimate rather than pretending
   * this is free.
