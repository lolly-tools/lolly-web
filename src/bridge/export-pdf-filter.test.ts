 * `filter: blur()` and `filter: drop-shadow()` reaching PDF export (plan 104 §2, P1d).
 *
 * Until this landed they did not reach it at all, and did so SILENTLY: the PDF walker
 * has no `filter` branch, but `detectUnsupportedCss` declared any parseable filter
 * "supported" for every caller, so the raster escape hatch never fired and the effect
 * was simply absent from the file. No warning, no degraded version, nothing. That made
 * design's DOF blur and its `shadow: content` / `shadow: depth` silhouettes
 * PDF-invisible - the two effects plan 104's depth work is built out of.
 *
 * The oracle is the PDF's object structure, not pixels. "Did the effect survive into the
 * file at all" is exactly answerable by counting embedded image XObjects, and it is the
 * question that was wrong; how CLOSE the result is to the browser is already measured,
 * per-effect and against real pixels, by export-pdf-shadow-fidelity.test.ts.
 *
 * The SVG assertions are the other half. The fix is a capability SIGNAL - the SVG walker
 * declares `cssFilter` because it emits the chain, the PDF walker declines it because it
 * cannot - so the thing that could go wrong is the signal leaking and turning crisp SVG
 * filters into bitmaps. Every fixture is therefore checked in both sinks: raster in PDF,
 * still real `<filter>` primitives and NO `<image>` in SVG.
 *
 * Real Chromium, self-skipping when one isn't installed: `getComputedStyle` has to
 * resolve `filter` to its computed serialisation (jsdom returns '', and the nested
 * `rgba()` in that serialisation is exactly what the spill measurement used to trip
 * over), and the geometry has to be real layout. Same gated pattern as
 * export-backdrop-blur.test.ts (tests/README.md).
