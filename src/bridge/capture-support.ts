 * "Can this browser capture?" — the synchronous feature probes behind `host.media`
 * and `host.recorder`, split out of the two impl modules that used to each keep a
 * private copy.
 *
 * WHY A LEAF. Both contracts answer availability SYNCHRONOUSLY (`MediaAPI.isAvailable`,
 * `RecorderAPI.isAvailable`) — a shell decides whether to draw a "Go live" toggle or a
 * record button before anything is started — while everything else they do is async
 * and gesture-driven. That is exactly the shape `bridge/index.ts` builds lazy facades
 * for (host.viz's `isAvailable` beside a lazy `presets`, host.raster's `canRaster`,
 * host.speech's `isAvailable`), and each of those answers from the same probe module
 * the real impl calls rather than a re-typed copy, so the facade and the impl cannot
 * drift. This is that module for camera/mic/screen.
 *
 * Nothing here touches a device or prompts for anything: these are capability reads
 * on `navigator.mediaDevices` and the `MediaRecorder` constructor. A `true` never
 * implies a grant — the prompt happens on start()/record()/still().
