/**
 * sequence-cuts.ts — the CONTACT SHEET: N stills off one timed composition
 * (Fable timeline, phase 2.5 / plans/51-fable-timeline-editing.md §4.6).
 *
 * This is the STILL sibling of sequence-render.ts. Where that module decodes,
 * composites and muxes to produce motion, this one does none of those things: it
 * moves the DOM playhead, asks the ordinary still renderer for a picture, and
 * repeats. Every pixel therefore comes from exactly the same code path as a normal
 * PNG/SVG/PDF export — which is the whole point, because Andy's rule is that a
 * still of a sequence is WYSIWYG, and the cheapest way to keep N stills honest is
 * for each of them to be a plain still taken at a different time.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT (§4.6):
 *   cuts = 1 (default)  the frame at the playhead. Nothing in this module runs;
 *                       the dispatch in export.ts never reaches it. That path must
 *                       stay byte-identical — it is the common one.
 *   cuts = N > 1        N stills at MIDPOINT times t_i = totalMs * (i + 0.5) / N.
 *                       png/jpg/webp/svg → N members in one ZIP, `<base>-01.<ext>`;
 *                       pdf              → ONE document of N pages.
 *
 * WHY MIDPOINT. Endpoint sampling (`i/(N-1)`) spends frame 0 at t = 0, where an
 * `enter` transition is still at alpha 0 (a blank card), and the last frame at
 * t = totalMs, where every clip has ended. A 6-up sheet would be two-thirds
 * useful. The midpoint of each equal slice always lands inside a live span.
 *
 * THE FREEZE STILL HOLDS. `render()` in export.ts has already run `snapshotMotion`
 * on the live node (a still of a sequence keeps it — only MOTION formats skip it),
 * so every `<video>` is already an `<img>` of the frame the preview was parked on.
 * We deliberately do NOT re-seek per cut: the poster contract is "the video is
 * where you left it", and it holds for cut 12 exactly as it does for cut 1. What
 * moves between cuts is the timeline's own visibility state and the four inline
 * properties the applier composes — `transform`, `opacity`, and, on a stage that
 * authors depth (plans/104), `filter` and `z-index`. That list is all
 * `applySequenceTime` writes, and `restoreSequenceTime` hands every one of them back.
 *
 * AND THE STAGE IT STARTS FROM IS THE AUTHORED ONE. The whole run sits inside
 * `withAuthoredDom` (plans/104 §6 point 0): the preview clock has been writing those
 * same four properties for whatever frame the playhead is parked on, and this module's
 * session would capture that composed pose as "authored" the first time it touched a
 * box — so every cut would carry the parked frame baked in, and by how much would
 * depend on where the user last scrubbed.
 *
 * INJECTED DEPENDENCIES. The renderers stay in export.ts (they are that file's
 * private machinery) and arrive as `CutsDeps`. That is not ceremony: it is what
 * lets the loop, the clamping, the naming and the restore-in-`finally` be tested
 * headlessly in jsdom, where no pixel can ever be rasterised.
