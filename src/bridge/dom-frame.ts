/**
 * Deterministic DOM-motion frame sampling — the shared primitive behind
 * frame-accurate rasterisation of ANY animated DOM subtree (CSS `@keyframes`,
 * CSS transitions, Web-Animations, and SMIL inside inline SVG). It is NOT
 * SVG-specific: any live DOM node whose motion is declarative can be seeked to
 * an exact time and snapshotted, so the same code drives (a) the non-camera
 * live source that feeds `onFrame` tools like `filter`, and (b) the sequence
 * compositor's frame-addressable DOM layer — the way `<video>` (currentTime)
 * and Lottie (goToAndStop) are already frame-addressable.
 *
 * Why this exists: a CSS-animated element only advances at wall-clock while it
 * is live in the DOM, and exposes no seek API of its own — so every path that
 * rasterises it once (dom-to-image, an `<img>` decode) freezes it at whatever
 * phase it held. The Web Animations API is the missing seek: `getAnimations()`
 * enumerates the running animations on a subtree and each one's `currentTime`
 * is writable. Pausing first makes the seek stick (an unpaused animation would
 * immediately resume ticking from the seeked point on the next frame).
 *
 * A NODE MUST BE CONNECTED and its SVG INLINE for this to work: `getAnimations`
 * sees nothing inside an `<img>`-embedded SVG (opaque document), and computed
 * styles don't resolve on a detached clone. Callers inline + attach off-screen
 * (see anim-svg-mount) before seeking. `export.ts` carries a private copy of
 * the WAAPI half (`scrubAnimations`) for the single-tool video path; new
 * callers import from here so there is one seek contract.
