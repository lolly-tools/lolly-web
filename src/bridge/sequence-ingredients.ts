/**
 * sequence-ingredients.ts - the export-side gather that keeps a timeline clip's
 * Content Credentials attached to the film it ends up inside (plans/130).
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR. `renderFormat` stamps ONE container-level credential onto a
 * finished sequence, and that credential is only honest if it names what the film
 * was made of. A camera-shot clip, an AI-generated clip and a licensed catalog
 * track each arrive carrying their own signed manifest; unless those manifests are
 * copied forward as ingredients, an export launders every one of them away and the
 * result reads as if it were authored from nothing.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A MODULE AND NOT FOUR LINES IN THE RENDERER. `renderSequenceAuthored`
 * cannot be reached headlessly - its frame loop is canvas, WebCodecs and
 * dom-to-image, and it is covered by the Playwright tier. Everything decided here
 * is policy (which source of truth wins, what a failure costs, when a scan is too
 * expensive to be worth attempting), and policy that cannot be run in a test is
 * policy that rots. So the two IO seams arrive as injected functions and this file
 * owns no globals: sequence-render.ts supplies the real ones, a node test supplies
 * fakes.
 *
 * THE RESOLUTION ORDER IS NOT AN OPTIMISATION. `credentialForUrl` is asked first
 * because for the sources most likely to BE credentialed it is the only answer that
 * exists at all: an upload's stored pixels were re-encoded at ingest, so its C2PA
 * store no longer sits in the bytes the timeline plays - it was kept beside the
 * record and is reachable only by asset id. Scanning that clip's URL finds nothing,
 * every time. The byte scan is the fallback for the sources with no id to find: a
 * catalog clip served over http, or a file dropped straight onto the timeline.
 *
 * EVERY CLIP IS A COMPONENT, NEVER A PARENT. The embedder defaults an ingredient
 * with no relationship to `parentOf`, and that is the wrong word twice over here: a
 * film is not derived FROM one clip, it is composed WITH all of them (the same case
 * the SVG/PDF walker stamps `componentOf` on for a bitmap it inlines), and C2PA
 * allows at most one `parentOf` ingredient per claim - so a two-clip timeline
 * written the default way reports multipleParents and the whole credential reads as
 * invalid, which is worse than carrying no ingredients at all.
 *
 * BEST-EFFORT, ALWAYS. Carrying no credential is the ordinary case, and an
 * unreadable one is not the user's problem at the moment they asked for a film.
 * Every failure path - a fetch that 404s, bytes that sniff as nothing, a store that
 * will not parse, a dependency that throws - resolves to "no ingredient" and the
 * export carries on. Nothing in this file throws.
 *
 * Run its tests with:
 *   node --import ./tests/css-stub.mjs --test shells/web/src/bridge/sequence-ingredients.test.ts
