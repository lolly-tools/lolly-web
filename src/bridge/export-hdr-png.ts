 * HDR PNG at 16 bits per channel - the first "invisible upgrade" of
 * plans/61-deeprichpixels.md §10 item 2.
 *
 * Before this module, `?hdr=1&format=png` ran the canvas through the engine's
 * legacy byte path (`hdrBoostToPQ`: 8-bit in, 8-bit PQ code values out) and then
 * spliced a cICP chunk into the browser's own PNG bytes. That is §1's sharpest
 * recorded defect: PQ is a 10/12-bit transfer by design, so quantising it to 8
 * bits bands the shadows - the very place PQ spends its code values. The fix is
 * not a new toggle: the same `hdr=` request now routes through the float view
 * transform and lands in a 16-bit IDAT written by the engine's own encoder.
 *
 *   canvas RGBA8 -> fromU8Srgb (linear f32)
 *                -> hdrViewTransform  (brand boost, Rec.2020 linear, unbounded)
 *                -> pqEncodeFrame     (203-nit BT.2408 anchor, full precision)
 *                -> pqToU16           (0..65535, the precision PQ was designed for)
 *                -> packPng           (depth 16, cICP 9/16/0/1, pHYs)
 *
 * ─── Why this is not padding (the honesty rule, plan §10) ────────────────────
 * "Depth follows provenance - never emit bits the pipeline did not produce."
 * A 16-bit TIFF of an 8-bit canvas render is padding. This is NOT that: the
 * bits below the 8th are *generated* by real float math on the way out. The
 * boost gain is continuous, the sRGB->Rec.2020 primary matrix is continuous,
 * and the PQ curve is steeply non-linear - three 256-valued inputs map to
 * distinct, unevenly-spaced 16-bit outputs, so the low byte carries signal
 * rather than a `v * 257` replication. The test asserts exactly that (a 16-bit
 * output whose low bytes were mere padding would fail it). What the file does
 * NOT claim is deeper *source* material: the render is still an 8-bit canvas,
 * and the honest statement is that the HDR view transform is the thing being
 * recorded at full precision. Vector-render-in-float (Phase D) is what raises
 * the source; this raises the transform.
 *
 * ─── depth= interaction ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `depth=8` is IGNORED here (with a logged note): 8-bit PQ *is* the banding
 * defect the plan forbids, so honouring the request would re-introduce it under
 * a different name. `depth=float` is also noted and satisfied at 16 - PNG has no
 * float sample format (that is EXR's job, plan §4.2 B3). 16/auto/absent take
 * this path silently, which is what "auto = the deepest the provenance chain
 * supports" means for an HDR PNG.
 *
 * ─── Metadata parity with the old splice path ────────────────────────────────
 * The old path emitted, all spliced after IHDR: pHYs (dpi), one iTXt per
 * provenance field, cICP (Rec.2100 PQ), iCCP (pqBt2020IccProfile). Every one of
 * those still ships. pHYs + cICP are now written natively by `packPng` (its
 * pHYs arithmetic is asserted equal to `insertPngPhys`'s by tests/png.test.ts);
 * the iTXt and iCCP chunks go through the SAME `insertPngMeta` / `insertPngIcc`
 * splicers as before, so there is no second copy of that logic to drift. Chunk
 * ORDER among these ancillaries differs from the old path (the splicers each
 * insert directly after IHDR, so the last one inserted comes first) - PNG places
 * no ordering requirement on them beyond "before IDAT", which holds.
 *
 * C2PA: `engine/src/c2pa-containers.ts#placePng` walks the chunk list generically
 * (length/type/CRC, insert `caBX` after IHDR, drop any pre-existing one). It
 * reads nothing out of IHDR beyond its length and makes no assumption about who
 * encoded the file or at what depth, so a 16-bit PNG from this path stamps
 * exactly like a browser-encoded 8-bit one. Verified by test below.
 *
 * ─── Pixel marks (imprint / durable) ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * Both marks are 8-bit RGBA operations, and the old path deliberately ran them
 * AFTER the PQ transform so the mark lives in the delivered pixel space. That
 * ordering is preserved here without dropping precision: the mark is computed on
 * an 8-bit quantisation of the PQ signal (byte-for-byte what the legacy path
 * would have produced), and only the resulting per-sample DELTA is applied to
 * the 16-bit buffer, scaled by 257 (the 8->16-bit unit). The delivered file's
 * top 8 bits therefore carry precisely the pattern a detector expects, while the
 * low byte keeps the PQ precision. A mark is never silently skipped.
 *
 * ─── Size (the plan §9b blocker, lifted in Phase B3) ─────────────────────────
 * This path used to refuse past ~2.1 megapixels, because `deflate.ts` compressed
 * in one shot with ~8x scratch: a 4K 16-bit master (8.3 MP, ~66 MiB filtered)
 * meant ~530 MiB of tokenizer scratch, and the alternative - a stored,
 * uncompressed IDAT - shipped a ~66 MB file from an existing link. Neither is
 * acceptable, so the export fell back to the legacy 8-bit PQ path.
 * `deflate.ts` now streams (`createZlibStream`: one 32 KB window carried across
 * slabs, constant scratch) and `packPng` feeds it one filtered scanline at a
 * time above its own threshold, never allocating the whole-image buffer. So a
 * 4K 16-bit HDR PNG now compresses properly, in a few hundred KB of working
 * memory. `maxDeflateBytes` survives as a plain sanity bound on the returned
 * buffer (1 GiB of filtered bytes ≈ 134 MP); a caller passing a smaller cap
 * still gets the loud refusal, which is the seam the export path falls back on.
 *
 * DOM-free on purpose: the whole path is `Uint8ClampedArray` in, `Uint8Array`
 * out, so it is driven directly by node:test with no canvas (export-hdr-png.test.ts).
