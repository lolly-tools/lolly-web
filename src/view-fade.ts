/**
 * Cross-view fade — hides the blank frame between one view being torn down and
 * the next being painted.
 *
 * The router (main.ts) swaps views by clearing #view and mounting the next view's
 * markup into it. That's fast — everything loads in well under a second — but fast
 * enough that the empty container still paints for a frame or two, reading as a
 * tiny blank flash on every navigation. This lifts the OUTGOING view's already-
 * rendered pixels into a snapshot layer pinned over the viewport, lets the incoming
 * view mount UNDERNEATH it at full opacity, then fades the snapshot out.
 *
 * The key property: because the incoming view sits underneath at full opacity,
 * anything IDENTICAL between the two views — the Tools|Projects|Catalog tab bar,
 * the language button, the profile link, the dashboard/verify "Tools" back-link —
 * stays rock-solid through the fade. The opaque new copy shows through the fading
 * old one pixel-for-pixel, so only what actually CHANGED cross-fades. Shared chrome
 * is held in place for free, with zero per-element wiring.
 *
 * Usage (main.ts): call {@link beginViewFade} with the #view element BEFORE its
 * scoping class flips or its markup is torn down — it MOVES the live nodes into the
 * overlay, leaving #view empty for the incoming mount. Then, once that mount has
 * written the new markup, call the returned handle's `commit()` to fade the
 * snapshot out. Reduced motion, an empty view, or first boot return null → the
 * caller falls back to today's instant swap.

  // background of its own (the page colour comes from `body`), so without this the
  // incoming view would show through the snapshot's transparent gaps — between
  // cards, the margins — the instant it mounted underneath, flashing before the
  // fade. hsl(var(--background)) is the same theme-aware token `body` uses, so the
  // frozen copy reads as a solid page until it fades out. `overflow:hidden` makes
  // the overlay a scroll container we can position by script; it deliberately does
  // NOT establish a containing block for position:fixed (only transform/filter/
  // contain would). That's load-bearing too: the top bar is fixed, so it must stay
  // pinned to the VIEWPORT in the snapshot — not scroll with the frozen body —
  // exactly as on the live page. So NO transform and NO `contain` here; the scroll
  // offset rides scrollTop below, moving only flow content and leaving fixed chrome put.
  // z-index sits above the in-view chrome — notably the mobile top bar at 99999,
  // re-rendered per view — so a top-left element that DIFFERS between views (the tab
  // bar vs the dashboard/verify "Tools" back-link) cross-fades uniformly instead of
  // snapping in on top. The 100000+ layers (filter popover, profile menu, dialogs)
  // are always closed during a route change, and the overlay is pointer-events:none,
  // so covering the viewport for the fade is purely visual and never swallows a click.
