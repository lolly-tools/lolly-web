/**
 * The collab surface's i18n contract — the guarantee the six STRINGS maps used to give
 * on their own, restated now that they are catalog KEYS rather than the copy itself.
 *
 * Each module already pins its own two halves (`collab-ceremony.test.ts`,
 * `beam-toast.test.ts`, `join-route.test.ts`): every string the DOM shows comes out of
 * that module's map, and the map is the only place copy lives in its source. Those two
 * were enough while the map WAS the rendered text. They are not enough now: a value can
 * be in the map, render verbatim, and still be a string no translator ever sees — which
 * is exactly what `collab-pill.ts` and `collab-focus.ts` were before this wave, with
 * their copy in inline `tRaw('…')` literals that scripts/translate.ts cannot scan.
 *
 * So this file closes the loop, in four parts:
 *
 *  1. TRACEABILITY. Every value in every collab STRINGS map is a key in all 26 shipped
 *     `locales/collab/<lang>.json` catalogs. Rendered ⊆ map (per module) plus map ≡
 *     catalog (here) is the end-to-end "every rendered string traces to a key".
 *  2. TRANSLATION ACTUALLY HAPPENS. Every `STRINGS` reference in those modules' source
 *     sits inside a `t()`/`tRaw()` call. A map of keys is worthless if a render site
 *     reads one straight out of it — that renders English forever, in every language,
 *     with nothing failing. This is the part no runtime assertion can reach, because in
 *     English a missed call site and a correct one produce identical output.
 *  3. FALLBACK. A language whose catalog is missing renders English — not a blank, not a
 *     raw key — through the real i18n runtime and a real mounted component.
 *  4. THE BOOT CARVE-OUT. The eight strings that render on ordinary chrome with the flag
 *     off stay in the `spa` corpus: the three dynamic Feature-flags-row strings are
 *     listed in extra-keys.spa.json, and the Share rows stay literal `t('…')` calls.
 *
 * Run directly:
 *   node --import ./tests/css-stub.mjs --test shells/web/src/collab-i18n.test.ts
