/**
 * Pro / Batch mode — the BATCH PREFLIGHT COLLECTOR.
 *
 * The third fact collector, beside `views/tool-actions.ts` (`refreshPreflight`, the
 * mounted single-tool panel) and `shells/cli/src/preflight.ts` (headless, one job).
 * The engine owns the RULES (`engine/src/preflight.ts`); each shell collects the
 * FACTS from its own platform. This one collects them for ONE ROW of a bulk run,
 * and it is what closes the seam `planBatch`'s `check` was left as:
 *
 *     const { check, runFindings } = await createBatchRowCheck(rows, host, run);
 *     const plan = await planBatch<Finding>(rows, { check });
 *
 * Three channels come out, and they are not interchangeable: the per-row findings on
 * the plan (queue-space, for the runner), `runFindings` (properties of the platform or
 * the brand — see {@link RUN_LEVEL_IDS} — emitted ONCE), and {@link skippedFindings}
 * (the dropped rows, which have no queue position and are keyed by identity).
 *
 * ## Tier 1 only. Nothing here renders, mounts, or exports.
 *
 * A batch pre-pass runs BEFORE the first row is mounted, so every fact that needs a
 * node is a NAMED GAP, never a zero (`plans/preflight-and-cost.md` §4, §6):
 *
 *   - `stage` is `{ known: false, why: 'needs-mount' }`, exactly as the CLI reports
 *     it. Handing the engine an all-false `StageFacts` would make `isSequence`
 *     read as "checked, and it is not a sequence", so `count.cuts-inert` would
 *     assert an answer no one measured. The `Fact` union has no third shape for
 *     precisely this reason.
 *   - There is no runtime, so `onInit` has NOT run: `modelPhase` is `'declared'`
 *     and every hook-patchable count comes back as a ceiling rather than a fact.
 *
 * ## Settings parity is the whole point
 *
 * A preflight that checks settings the render will not use is worse than none. So
 * every setting below is resolved by the SAME helpers `runBatch` calls, in the same
 * order, and nothing is re-derived:
 *
 *   - format  → `chooseFormat(manifest, row.format || run.format)` — the exact call
 *     `renderRowToBlob` makes, including its fall-through to the tool's first
 *     declared format when neither level named one (the folder/selection paths).
 *   - unit/dpi → `row.unit ?? run.unit ?? 'px'`, and DPI only for a physical unit,
 *     `row.dpi ?? run.dpi ?? 300` — `runBatch`'s two lines, restated nowhere.
 *   - bleed/marks/press profile → `printSettingsFor(row, run, run.format)`, the
 *     GATE itself, imported from `./batch.ts`. Row-beats-run precedence and the
 *     "non-print formats carry none of these" rule therefore hold by construction:
 *     if the gate ever changes, preflight moves with the renderer.
 *
 * ## No currency, no rates, no money
 *
 * Counts and findings only, permanently. See `plans/preflight-and-cost.md` §6, §8.

 * The output size THIS ROW will render at, as `renderRowToBlob` and the export
 * bridge together resolve it.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing and none of them is obvious:
 *
 * 1. **One declared dimension IS a declaration.** `renderRowToBlob` computes
 *    `bothGiven` for LAYOUT only; `outW`/`outH` are built independently
 *    (`render-export.ts:315-317`), so a row carrying `outWidth: 210` with
 *    `unit: 'mm'` and no height really does hand the export boundary
 *    `width: '210mm'`, and the PDF page really is 210mm wide. Reporting the
 *    manifest's pixel canvas for it made the engine say "no physical page size was
 *    declared" about a job that declared one. So any positive dimension is
 *    `declaredBy: 'row'` and the missing one is left at 0 — the CLI's `sizeFacts`
 *    shape exactly, which drives `print.trim-partially-declared`, the truthful
 *    finding, and blocks every area/pixel derivation (`physicalTrim` requires both
 *    `> 0`).
 * 2. **A dimension-less raster row does not render at the manifest canvas.** With
 *    neither dimension given, `exportOpts.width/height` are `undefined`,
 *    `rasterStyle` takes its NOT-`requested` branch and the output is the node box
 *    times {@link RASTER_DEFAULT_SCALE}. A 600 x 600 tool produces a 1200 x 1200
 *    PNG, so reporting 600 x 600 shipped a `bound: 'exact'` pixel count four times
 *    too small on the commonest batch row there is. Vector/PDF rows keep the
 *    unscaled box: `toPoints` is applied to the node box and `rasterStyle` never
 *    runs for them.
 * 3. **`unitDeclared` is true only when a unit was SPELLED OUT** — by the row's own
 *    `unit` cell or by the run's toolbar unit. `runBatch` defaults to `'px'` when
 *    neither did, and a `px` fallback is not a declaration: with `unitDeclared`
 *    false the engine refuses to derive a print area rather than trusting a unit
 *    nobody typed.
 *
 * `format`/`print` are resolved here when the caller does not supply them, by the
 * same two helpers `preflightJobForRow` uses, so a 3-argument call is still right.

 * A skipped row's findings are filed under `rowIndex: -1`, which `notesFromFindings`
 * discards by design (correctly — the runner's channel is queue-space). Without this
 * they reached no surface at all: `buildPreflightReport` hard-coded `findings: []` for
 * every unmade row with no runner index, so the one case plan §7 says preflight most
 * exists for ("the skipped, the errored and the cancelled are precisely the set a
 * preflight report is for") shipped as an empty array in `preflight.json`.
 *
 * `srcIndex` is read back off the finding itself: `preflightRow` stamps every finding
 * with `ctx.srcIndex`, so the identity travels inside the payload and does not depend
 * on a `uid` the /pro grid may not have set.

 * Build the `check` for `planBatch<Finding>(rows, { check })`.

 * Async because the two RUN-INVARIANT facts — the brand palette and the user
 * profile — are async and `check` is not; both are resolved once here and shared by
 * every row. The tool manifests are pre-loaded for the same reason: `planBatch`
 * loads them itself but does not hand them to `check`, and `getTool` is CACHED
 * per tool id (`bridge/tool-loader.ts`), so this costs one fetch per DISTINCT
 * template for the whole run and zero for the second row using it.
 *
 * A tool that will not load is left out of the map on purpose. `planBatch` is about
 * to drop that row with 'Failed to load template', and the row gets the skip caveat
 * instead of an invented job.
