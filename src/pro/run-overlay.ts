/**
 * Pro / Batch mode - the batch-run progress shell, made mount-agnostic.
 *
 * This is the rotating-quip + progress-head + Cancel + live-log UI plus the
 * runBatch call and the zip/sequential delivery, extracted from runBatchFlow so
 * it can render into either:
 *   - the docked `#pro-progress` panel (the in-grid batch run), or
 *   - nothing at all: with no `mount` the shell is built detached and the global
 *     job toast (lib/job-toast.ts) is the run's only visible surface. That is the
 *     shape every non-/pro caller uses now - a folder, a selection, one session,
 *     a multi-edit download-all, "Export everything" - because a run must outlive
 *     the view that started it, and a view-owned toast cannot.
 *
 * Every run reports into a WP-F job (lib/batch-job.ts): progress, cancellation and
 * failure all travel through the handle, so leaving the view costs the cards and
 * the log but never the run, its progress or its download.
 *
 * It owns its own cancel flag and quip rotator. It deliberately does NOT touch
 * any /pro grid state (state.running / renderGrid) - the docked caller passes an
 * `onRendered` hook to flip those once the renders finish, before delivery.
