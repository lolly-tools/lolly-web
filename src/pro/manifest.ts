 * so `zip.ts` stays about bytes. Two consumers, deliberately fed from the same
 * assembly so they can never disagree: the human `lolly.txt` block and the machine
 * `preflight.json` member.
 *
 * **Index identity is the whole point of this module.** Three index spaces exist:
 *
 *   - SOURCE — position in the array the user assembled (the /pro grid, or
 *     `rowsForFolder`'s concatenated output). The only number a human can point at.
 *   - RUNNER — position in the array handed to `runBatch`, i.e. `planBatch().renderable`.
 *     What `BatchProgress.index` / `BatchResult.index` and the zip's `NN-` prefix speak.
 *   - FILE — position in `files[]`.
 *
 * `planBatch` compacts, so an index captured before it points at a different row
 * afterwards; `BatchPlan.srcIndex` is the only bridge, and every row number that
 * reaches a person goes through it. A row number is therefore always a FIELD here,
 * never a substring baked into a sentence.
