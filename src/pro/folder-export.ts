 * Pro / Batch mode - render a whole folder (group) as one batch.
 *
 * A folder collects saved sessions. Each session contributes rows to one combined
 * batch run that delivers a single zip with a nested folder tree:
 *   - a batch session (a subgroup) contributes ALL its rows, under
 *     `<group>/<subgroup>/…`
 *   - a single-tool session contributes one row, under `<group>/…`
 *
 * Row assembly is the pure logic in ./folder-rows.js (also used by pro/index.js to
 * flatten a folder into the grid). This module adds the planning + run shell, so it
 * is the part lazy-loaded by the shared overlay at export time (Batch export, now
 * available to everyone - the pro-batch flag was retired).
