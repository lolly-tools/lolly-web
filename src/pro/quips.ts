 * Pro / Batch mode — wait-time quips.
 *
 * Short, cheeky two-line lines shown while a batch renders, to entertain during
 * a big job. `[Count]` is replaced with the TOTAL number of renders in the job;
 * `[Remaining]` with how many are still to go (for lines phrased "N to go"). The
 * two lines are split on the newline. Pure data + one formatter — the run loop in
 * index.js shuffles and rotates them. Delete this file + its call sites to drop
 * the whole bit.
 *
 * Voice: first-person, confident, self-deprecating. Themes to keep hitting —
 * local compute / privacy, free vs. an agency, open-source ribbing, raw speed,
 * "this is the most powerful way", and the sheer busywork of a batch.
