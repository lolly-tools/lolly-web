 * Structural invariants for the 26 translated UI catalogs (src/locales/<lang>.json).
 *
 * Nothing checked these before. The catalogs are produced two ways - the machine
 * pipeline (scripts/translate.ts) and hand/agent waves writing through
 * scripts/i18n/overrides/ - and BOTH can silently break a string in ways that only
 * show up as a bug report from someone who doesn't read English:
 *
 *   - a dropped `{name}` placeholder renders "Welcome back, " with a blank where a
 *     person's name should be, or throws on a missing interpolation
 *   - an invented placeholder interpolates nothing and prints the braces literally
 *   - a translated product name ("Lolly" → "Piruleta") breaks recognition, and the
 *     glossary lists exactly which terms must survive
 *   - a key some catalogs carry and others do not renders English in the ones that lack
 *     it, and looks like nothing at all in a diff of any single file
 *
 * A catalog is keyed BY its English source string, so the English side of every
 * comparison is right there in the key - no separate source of truth to drift from.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT checked: whether the translation is any good. That is a human
 * judgement and this file makes no attempt at it.
