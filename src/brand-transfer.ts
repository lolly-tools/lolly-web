/**
 * Portable `.lolly` design-system pack - "hand your brand to someone else".
 *
 * Where data-transfer.ts moves a PERSON between devices, this moves a BRAND
 * between people: one `.lolly` carrying the active design tokens, every locally
 * installed font face (the actual woff2 bytes - the receiver renders your type
 * with zero network), and the brand-adjacent preferences (theme). Export it
 * from Profile → Adjust your brand or the #/start wizard; anyone loads it from
 * the same places and their whole install wears the brand - chrome, tools,
 * exports.
 *
 * The envelope copies the backup bundle's proven rules (docs/data-transfer.md):
 * a `minReader` gate instead of an exact version match (additive parts keep
 * old readers working), SHA-256 per part so a mangled transfer fails loudly,
 * and unknown parts are counted, never silently dropped. Same fflate
 * worker/sync split, too.
 *
 * Import is merge-not-wipe: tokens install at the active head (the same
 * write path as the wizard), fonts land as `type:'font'` user assets (quota-
 * checked; a full disk skips a face, never aborts the pack), and the primary
 * face follows the pack's `font.brand` token automatically because that IS the
 * doc. Nothing else on the device is touched.
 *
 * Published VERSIONS travel too (plans/97 section 6a): `versions/<slug>.json` per
 * published version, `frozen/<sha12>.<ext>` for bytes a version pinned and the
 * head has since replaced, and `versions.json` for the ledger as published. Two
 * merge rules make that safe, and both are stated in the import result:
 *   - **a slug already in the LOCAL ledger is never overwritten.** Two teams' "v2"
 *     are different design systems, and a published version is permanent - so the
 *     incoming one is skipped and counted, not silently merged over the top.
 *   - **the pack's active version is adopted only when nothing is active locally.**
 *     Loading someone's pack must not change what every tool on this device
 *     renders against.
 * A pack from a system that never published carries none of these parts, and
 * loading it does exactly what it did before they existed.
 *
 * Both directions can now name WHICH design system they mean (plans/186 section
 * 3.6). A pack is always written in the portable `user/fonts/…` / `user/logo/…`
 * shape, whichever namespace it was exported from, so importing it is a re-key
 * into the namespace it is written to, and the references follow the ids. Name
 * nothing and both directions read and write the active system, byte for byte as
 * they did before design systems could be told apart.
